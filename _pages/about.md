I am a Director of the Intelligent Robot Special Project at [Beijing General Research Institute of Mining & Metallurgy](http://english.bgrimm.com/index.htm) Intelligent Technology.

Our team specializes in intelligent mining, encompassing the intelligent retrofitting of mining equipment and the research of mining robots. I am broadly interested in Robotics, Control Theory, and Machine Learning. These days, I am mostly drawn by the development of quadruped/humanoid robot. A topic that I am actively thinking about/working on is the application of quadruped robot and humanoid robot in the field of mining.

 **If you resonate with this, we welcome any form of [cooperation](http://www.bgrimmit.com/gywm).**

Previously, I obtained my PhD from the College of Mechanical & Energy Engineering at Beijing University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Jianfeng Li](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4338-6420). My PhD research focused on developing human-robot interaction strategies to achieve robot-assisted rehabilitation training. Part of my efforts are devoted to studying biomechanical models of the ankle joint, while another part is dedicated to developing robot control strategies.
