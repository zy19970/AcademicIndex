I am a third-year PhD student at the Faculty of Materials and Manufacturing, Beijing University of Technology. I am extremely fortunate to be advised Prof. [Jianfeng Li](https://fmm.bjut.edu.cn/info/1132/1565.htm). Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, North China University of Technology. I am broadly interested in Medical Robotics, Control Theory and Automation & Robotics.
