I am a third-year PhD student at the Faculty of Materials and Manufacturing, Beijing University of Technology. I am extremely fortunate to be advised Prof. [Jianfeng Li](https://fmm.bjut.edu.cn/info/1132/1565.htm). Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, North China University of Technology. 

I am broadly interested in Medical Robotics, Control Theory, and Machine Learning. These days, I am mostly drawn by the development of large language models. A topic that I am actively thinking about/working on is How to build effective physical human-robot interaction strategies through multimodal information.

I always welcome the opportunity to collaborate and discuss my research. Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you're interested.

I'm actively looking for a full-time position! Let's connect if you happen to know any good fittings.
