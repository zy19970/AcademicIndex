Both admittance and impedance control provide ways to regulate the interaction between a robot and its environment. These control strategies are crucial for applications such as robotic assembly, manipulation, physical human-robot interaction, and haptic feedback systems.

I focus on research in the [IEEExplore](IEEExplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) database. This page collects recent research effort in this line. (**Update: April 2023**)
