**Keywords**: Actuators; assistive robot; Damping; Human-robot interaction; Impedance control; interconnection and damping assignment passivity; physical human–robot interaction; Robots; Robustness; Springs; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: Interest in series elastic actuators (SEAs) for assistive robots has recently increased due to the unique properties of SEAs compared to those of rigid actuators, such as high force control accuracy, low output impedance, and tolerance to shocks. In this letter, an SEA with a clutch for an assistive robot is designed for accurate torque delivery to provide effective assistance. The mechanical clutch controls the engagement and disengagement of the power transmission during the gait cycle to ensure transparency and user safety. Precise torque control is the main challenge in the control of SEAs. The addition of a clutch in the SEA will result in a new force control challenge with the frequent release and engagement of the clutch aggravating the mechanical vibration and bringing the risk of unsafety to the assistive robot wearer. A new torque control method based on interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) for SEAs is adopted for the physical human-robot interaction. Experiments are conducted to verify that the IDA-PBC-based SEA torque controller can effectively control actuator timing and allow precise assistive torque control. This letter serves as a stepping stone toward utilizing and designing assistive robots to assist with walking.

- (2019) Robust Impedance-Matching of Manipulators Interacting With Uncertain Environments: Application to Task Verification of the Space Station's Dexterous Manipulator, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2928281.<br>
**Keywords**: Contact dynamics; dexterous robotics; Dynamics; Force; force control; hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation; Impedance; impedance control; Manipulator dynamics; robust control; simulating robots; space robotics; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: A systematic design method is developed for the identification and control of a simulating robot in order to adjust its contact force and impact dynamics to match those of a reference robot when both robots couple to a similar physical environment with unknown impedance. The control architecture, which is based on closed-loop impedance matching between two robots, is utilized by a hydraulic robot testbed facility for high-fidelity task verification of the space station's dexterous manipulator without requiring contact dynamics modeling. First, the uncertain environment is modeled in terms of parameter uncertainty bounds for a class of environment impedances. Then, the control goal is specifically defined as to minimize the contact-force error between the two robots, where the contact force is caused either by time-varying operator commands or impacts due to a nonzero preimpact velocity. Next, a hierarchical control architecture is formulated in the general framework of linear fractional transformation system by making use of the frequency-domain specifications of the robots together with the environment's parameter uncertainty bounds. It is shown that the overall system uncertainty can be represented by a perturbation block in the feedback form, which can be specified by a block structure array by making use of a unitary transformation. Subsequently, a $\mu$-synthesis-based controller is developed and implemented to achieve the dynamical similarity while maintaining contact stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the simulating robot can generate high-fidelity contact-force profile and impulsive force for different environments without contact dynamics modeling.

- (2019) Admittance Shaping-Based Assistive Control of SEA-Driven Robotic Hip Exoskeleton, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2916546.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance shaping-based control; assistive control; Exoskeletons; Hip; hip exoskeleton; Impedance; Legged locomotion; Muscles; series elastic actuator (SEA); Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper presents an admittance shaping-based assistive control for a series elastic actuator (SEA) driven robotic hip exoskeleton that can assist individuals with hip muscle weakness to restore normative mobility. The motivation for this paper is to develop a unified controller framework for designing an SEA-driven hip exoskeleton to assist walking and enhance gait stability. The controller design aims to modify the dynamic response of a coupled human-exoskeleton system, i.e., the relationship between the net muscle torque exerted by the human and the resulting angular motion, to ensure strong human-exoskeleton synergy to provide the effective assistance. This controller was preliminarily evaluated on a healthy subject walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.0 m/s. Results showed that the exoskeleton can effectively provide walking assistance to the human by reducing electromyography (EMG) activation and increasing agility during locomotion. Specifically, EMG was reduced 3.3%-38% when walking with the hip exoskeleton when compared to walking without wearing the hip exoskeleton. In addition, timing of the maximum hip flexion angle increased by 10% (moved from 42% to 32% of gait cycle) when the controller had an inertia compensation of 60%. The faster onset of the maximum flexion angle will allow the wearer to more quickly generate reactive steps when trying to avoid a fall. Future work will aim to apply the hip exoskeleton to persons having hip muscle weakness or other musculoskeletal impairment, to restore hip movement and enough hip force to walk normally.

- (2019) Variable Admittance Control of Robot Manipulators Based on Human Intention, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2910237.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance control; Damping; Force; human intention; Manipulators; physical human–robot interaction; Robot sensing systems; Standards; variable admittance.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper presents a variable admittance control method to achieve intuitive human-robot interactions that consider human intentions. Human intention is classified into two categories-direct and indirect. With respect to direct intention, the concept of standard force is introduced to adjust the interacting force. The proposed variable admittance control method improves intuitiveness when velocity is used as an estimate of direct intention. In the estimation of indirect intention, a force guidance method is suggested to make a robot follow and guide a human. The proposed control methodology is adapted to a six-DOF manipulator based on a one-dimensional analysis. The experiments are conducted with a manipulator (Universal Robots, UR10) and a force/torque sensor (Robotus, RFT60-HA) to evaluate the performance. The experiments validate that variable admittance control enhances the execution time, accuracy, and comfort of the operator.

- (2019) Predictive Optimization of Assistive Force in Admittance Control-Based Physical Interaction for Robotic Gait Assistance, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2019.2928770.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Assistive devices; Force; human-centered robotics; Legged locomotion; model predictive optimization; Optimization; Physical human-robot interaction; physically assistive devices; robotic gait assistance; Senior citizens.<br>
**Abstract**: In this letter, we introduce our approach to walking assistance for elderly adults through predictive optimization of gait assistive force. We focus on providing supportive interaction force to the user during walking with a robotic assistive device with an admittance controlled mobile base. Appropriate physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) could be beneficial in reducing the risk associated with immobility such as disuse syndrome by encouraging physical activities with proper assistance. We propose an optimization algorithm based on a model predictive control approach in order to provide desirable assistive forces according to the estimated user's state during walking. Using a simplified human gait model with a linear inverted pendulum, we formulate the optimization of the assistive forces as a linear quadratic programming problem that can be suitable for real-time pHRI. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our gait support strategy in achieving appropriate compliant interactions during walking, fall prevention, and suitable positioning for user companion.

- (2019) Stiffness Bounds for Resilient and Stable Physical Interaction of Articulated Soft Robots, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2019.2931249.<br>
**Keywords**: Compliance and impedance control; Force; Impedance; modeling, control, and learning for soft robots; natural machine motion; physical human-robot interaction; Soft robotics; Stability analysis; Surface impedance; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: It is widely recognized that impedance modulation is a key aspect in applications in which robots significantly interact with the environment or humans. Either active impedance controllers or actuators with passive variable impedance can be exploited to modulate the impedance. However, methods capable of determining the right (constant or time-varying) impedance profile in order to guarantee task performance as well as resilience and stability are required. In this letter, we discuss how task-related aspects, such as uncertainties, contact surface shapes, and interaction forces, set bounds on the admissible Cartesian stiffness. We recall that, an upper bound on the stiffness is required to prevent high forces exchanged during the interaction to guarantee adaptability and safety. Despite this, however, there is also a lower bound to be considered in order to preserve stability during the interaction. To this purpose, we study the interaction of a robot, with controllable Cartesian impedance, with a curved surface. Thus, we provide an analytic lower bound for the Cartesian stiffness that guarantees stability of such interaction task, and we prove that this bound directly depends on task parameters, namely contact force and surface curvature. Theoretical results are experimentally validated on robots powered by variable stiffness actuators and compliance controlled industrial robots.

- (2019) Impedance Control of Hydraulic Actuation Systems With Inherent Backdrivability, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2932132.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Backdrivability; Dynamics; Force; force control; hydraulic actuation; Hydraulic systems; Impedance; impedance control; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: The demand for high-performance impedance control in electro-hydraulic actuation systems is a mainstream issue in the robot actuation research community. Although various nonlinear model-based impedance controllers have been developed and showed good performance in recent years, they remain hindered by the high cost of force sensors, and accurate internal dynamics models need to be derived to overcome the non-backdrivability and complex dynamics of hydraulic systems. As a solution to these problems, this paper presents an impedance control approach for hydraulic systems that require no external force sensors or chamber pressure sensors with a pressure control servovalve or backdrivable servovalve. First, we show that a backdrivable servovalve brings inherent backdrivability to hydraulic systems, such that high-performance impedance control can be implemented without requirement of force sensors and exact knowledge on the dynamics of hydraulic chambers, owing to its torque-source property and low effective valve inertia on the link side. Second, utilizing the obtained backdrivability, we develop a passivity-guaranteed impedance controller. A momentum-based external torque observation algorithm is incorporated to render desired impedance over a wide range, without using force/torque sensor. The performance of the proposed backdrivable servovalve and impedance controller was verified through extensive experimental results.

- (2019) Development of a Two-Axis Robotic Platform for the Characterization of Two-Dimensional Ankle Mechanics, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2892472.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Ankle device; ankle impedance; ankle mechanics; ankle robot; ankle stiffness; Extremities; Force; Impedance; Perturbation methods; Robot kinematics; robotic platform.<br>
**Abstract**: Accurate characterization of ankle mechanics in lower extremity function is essential to advance the design and control of robots physically interacting with the human lower extremities, such as lower limb exoskeletons, active orthoses, and prostheses. This paper presents a two-axis robotic platform developed for the characterization of important neuromechanical properties of the human ankle, namely mechanical impedance and energetic passivity. This robotic platform is capable of simulating a wide range of mechanical (haptic) environments as well as applying precisely controlled perturbations to the ankle in 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) spanning both the sagittal and frontal planes. These features provide us with a unique way to characterize two-dimensional ankle mechanics while humans perform various lower extremity tasks in realistic physical environments. A series of validation experiments demonstrated that the platform can provide rapid perturbations up to an angular velocity of 100°/s with an error less than 0.1° even under excessive loading and simulate a wide range of haptic environments, from compliant to highly stiff environments, with an error less than 2.1% of the commanded values. A pilot human study demonstrated that the robotic platform could accurately quantify intrinsic ankle impedance in 2 DOFs with reliability higher than 97.5%. This study also confirmed that the platform could be utilized to quantify energetic passivity of the ankle in 2 DOFs. Implications for the design and control of lower extremity robots are discussed.

- (2019) A Passivity-Based Nonlinear Admittance Control With Application to Powered Upper-Limb Control Under Unknown Environmental Interactions, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2912488.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance control; exoskeleton; Exoskeletons; Force; passivity-based control; Payloads; powered upper-limb; Robot sensing systems; Standards.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper presents an admittance controller based on the passivity theory for a powered upper-limb exoskeleton robot, which is governed by the nonlinear equation of motion. Passivity allows us to include a human operator and environmental interaction in the control loop. The robot interacts with the human operator via force/torque (F/T) sensor and interacts with the environment mainly via end-effectors. Although the environmental interaction cannot be detected by any sensors (hence unknown), passivity allows us to have natural interaction. An analysis shows that the behavior of the actual system mimics that of a nominal model as the control gain goes to infinity, which implies that the proposed approach is an admittance controller. However, because the control gain cannot grow infinitely in practice, the performance limitation according to the achievable control gain is also analyzed. The result of this analysis indicates that the performance in the sense of infinite norm increases linearly with the control gain. In the experiments, the proposed properties were verified using 1-DoF testbench, and an actual powered upper-limb exoskeleton was used to lift and maneuver the unknown payload.

- (2019) Adaptive Impedance Control Applied to Robot-Aided Neuro-Rehabilitation of the Ankle, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2018.2885165.<br>
**Keywords**: adaptive controller; assist-as-needed; Force; Impedance; impedance control; Measurement; Medical treatment; neuro-rehabilitation; Rehabilitation robotics; Robots; Torque; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: Robot-aided neuro-rehabilitation is a potential solution to help resolve the increasing demand for post-stroke therapy. In this letter, we propose an assistive-resistive approach to promote active patient participation during robotic therapy. In order to automatically determine the most appropriate level of task difficulty, we recommend a novel approach for real-time adaptation of the robotic assistance according to the instantaneous patient's participation and performance. First, we estimated the dynamic con tribution of the patient from robot's torque and kinematic data. Second, we adapted the stiffness parameter of the robot's impedance control according to the purported patient's participation. And third, we adapted the robotic assistance according to his/her performance while playing a serious game. We present the results of a feasibility study in which we evaluated our methodology with four persons with impairments due to stroke in a single session using the ankle robot. Our proposed metric for performance and participation has potential implications for real-time assessment during robot-assisted therapy. The proposed adaptive strategy, when compared to a fixed-stiffness approach, allows more kinematic variability in patient-led movements without compromising the overall performance during therapy.

- (2020) Compliant Control and Compensation for A Compact Cable-Driven Robotic Manipulator, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2020.3007382.<br>
**Keywords**: compliance and impedance control; Dentistry; Hysteresis motors; Impedance; Kinematics; Manipulators; mechanism design; Medical robots and systems.<br>
**Abstract**: Cable-driven robotic manipulators are desirable for medical applications, for their form factor flexibility after separating actuation from the distal end. However, intended to work under high spatial constraints such as dental or other surgical applications, severe cable elongations will raise control challenges from inaccuracy to excessive compliance. It is critical to proactively regulate the system compliance, in order to achieve both compliant behavior to avoid tissue damage, and rigid behavior necessary for dental drilling. Both ends of this challenges have been extensively studied in literature, with rigidity achieved by cable elongation compensation, and virtual compliance regulation by impedance control. However, each approach worked within its own turf, with very little being studied in how to blend the two sources of compliance strategically. In this work, blending virtual compliance modulated by impedance control with transmission compliance induced by cable elasticity was investigated and demonstrated in a modified design of our proprietary dental manipulator. It was shown that direct application of impedance control in a cable-driven system would not bluntly increase compliance, and may cause instability. Instead, we proposed a compliance-blending framework with Cartesian-space super-positioning of cable motion compensation and impedance control, and validated the efficacy on the 6-DOF dental manipulator platform. Desirable results were achieved using highly common approaches in both impedance control and cable compensation, making the proposed approach applicable to a wide range of cable-driven robotic systems for impedance control.

- (2020) Improved Target Impedance Concept With Jitter Specification, **in** *IEEE Trans. Electromagn. Compat.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TEMC.2020.2996430.<br>
**Keywords**: Buffer; Impedance; Integrated circuits; jitter; Jitter; jitter transfer function; power supply induced jitter; Propagation delay; Switches; target impedance; Time-domain analysis; Transfer functions.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, an improved target impedance concept directly correlating circuit output jitter with power distribution network (PDN) R-L-C parameters is proposed. A systematic procedure to develop the target impedance curves is formulated and developed for common CMOS buffer circuits. The relationship between output jitter and PDN R-L-C parameters is analytically derived by evaluating the time domain voltage ripple to jitter transfer relationship along with the relationship between time domain voltage ripple and PDN R-L-C parameters. Given the transient integrated circuit switching current and the jitter specification, multiple target impedance curves can be defined for a specific circuit. The jitter and PDN R-L-C analytical correlations are validated through HSPICE simulation. The application of the proposed target impedance concept with jitter specification is also demonstrated via simulation.

- (2020) Sequence Impedance Modeling and Stability Analysis for Load Converters With Inertial Support, **in** *IEEE Trans. Power Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TPEL.2020.2995804.<br>
**Keywords**: Analytical models; Harmonic oscillation; Impedance; load converter; Load modeling; Perturbation methods; Power system stability; sequence impedance modeling; stability analysis; Stability analysis; virtual inertia; Voltage control; weak grid.<br>
**Abstract**: Load converters with inertial support are used to enhance the system inertia. However, these converters may fail to operate stably in the weak grid. In this article, sequence impedance modeling and stability comparison analysis are proposed for the load virtual synchronous machine (LVSM) and the load converter with virtual inertia control (LCVIC). First, the universal sequence impedance formulas are derived by considering dc-link voltage dynamics and frequency-coupling effects. Then, the precise sequence impedance models are built for impedance characteristics analysis of LVSM and LCVIC. The analysis shows that the positive-sequence impedance of LVSM is generally inductive in the middle-frequency band, which is basically consistent with the grid impedance. In contrast, the positive-sequence impedance of LCVIC is negative-resistive-capacitive (i.e., phase angle is between -180° and -90°) in the middle-frequency band, which may lead to harmonic oscillation in the weak grid. Furthermore, the effects of grid impedance, load power, and other control parameters on the stability are analyzed for the two load converters based on the derived model and Nyquist stability criterion. The analysis results reveal that LVSM has better stability than LCVIC in the weak grid. Finally, the experimental results validate the correctness of the theoretical analyses.

- (2020) Force Sensorless Admittance Control With Neural Learning for Robots With Actuator Saturation, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIE.2019.2912781.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive neural control; Admittance; admittance control; Force; Manipulators; neural networks (NNs); observer; Robot sensing systems; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a sensorless admittance control scheme for robotic manipulators to interact with unknown environments in the presence of actuator saturation. The external environment is defined as linear models with unknown dynamics. Using admittance control, the robotic manipulator is controlled to be compliant with external torque from the environment. The external torque acted on the end-effector is estimated by using a disturbance observer based on generalized momentum. The model uncertainties are solved by using radial basis neural networks (NNs). To guarantee the tracking performance and tackle the effect of actuator saturation, an adaptive NN controller integrating an auxiliary system is designed to handle the actuator saturation. By employing Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is achieved. The experiments on the Baxter robot are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Adaptive control; composite adaptation; Convergence; Impedance; impedance control; learning control; parameter convergence; Parameter estimation; robot; Robots; Stability criteria; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: The desired impedance dynamics can be achieved for a robot if and only if an impedance error converges to zero or a small neighborhood of zero. Although the convergence of impedance errors is important, it is seldom obtained in the existing impedance controllers due to robots modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. This brief proposes two composite learning impedance controllers (CLICs) for robots with parameter uncertainties based on whether a factorization assumption is satisfied or not. In the proposed control designs, the convergence of impedance errors, reflected by the convergence of parameter estimation errors and some auxiliary errors, is achieved by using composite learning laws under a relaxed excitation condition. The theoretical results are proven based on the Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed CLICs are validated by simulations on a parallel robot in three cases.

- (2020) An Improved Force Controller With Low and Passive Apparent Impedance for Series Elastic Actuators, **in** *IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2020.2970532.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Bandwidth; Disturbance observer; Exoskeletons; force control; Impedance; interaction control; PD control; robust control; series elastic actuators; Torque; Tuning.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a force controller for series elastic actuators that are used in gait robots, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and humanoid robots. Therefore, the controller needs to increase the bandwidth of the actuator, lower its apparent impedance for disturbance rejection or effortless interaction with a human user, and to stably interact with any (dynamic) environment. For gait, these environments are changing discontinuously, thus creating regular impacts. In this article, we propose the use of an inner-loop PD controller to increase the bandwidth of the actuator, alongside an outer-loop disturbance observer (DOB) to lower the apparent impedance of the actuator. To increase the controlled bandwidth of the actuator, we introduce a novel tuning method for the PD controller that allows for independent tuning of bandwidth and damping ratio of the controlled plant. The DOB, which is introduced to reject disturbances by lowering the apparent impedance, causes the apparent impedance to turn nonpassive, resulting in potential contact and coupled instability of the actuator. To enable unconditionally stable interactions with any environment, we scale down the DOB contribution such that it lowers the apparent impedance while remaining passive. The proposed tuning method and DOB adaptation were evaluated on a test setup by identifying the torque controller's transfer behavior and the apparent impedance of the actuator. The results of these tests showed that the proposed tuning method can separately tune bandwidth and damping ratio, whereas the DOB adaptation is able to tradeoff the reduction in the apparent impedance with its passivity.;This article presents a force controller for series elastic actuators that are used in gait robots, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and humanoid robots.

- (2020) Co-Actuation: A Method for Achieving High Stiffness and Low Inertia for Haptic Devices, **in** *IEEE Trans. Haptics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TOH.2019.2944611.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Brakes; Co-actuation; Force; force feedback; haptic device; Haptic interfaces; Impedance; physical constraint; Rendering (computer graphics); Sockets; stiffness rendering; transparency.<br>
**Abstract**: Achieving high stiffness and low inertia is a big challenge for current haptic devices. Impedance-based devices are limited in providing high stiffness while, in contrast, admittance-based devices are limited in generating low inertia. Thus, it is difficult to simulate hard contact and small inertia simultaneously in virtual environments. In this paper, we introduce a co-actuation module to overcome this difficulty. The module is a one degree-of-freedom (DOF) revolute joint which consists of a link and a physical constraint with a clearance between the two components. A motor controls the physical constraint moving cooperatively with the link. In free space, the constraint has no contact to the link and thus, users can move the link freely without feeling the inertia of the motor. In constrained space, the constraint comes into contact with the link and thus, users can feel a resistance from the motor. By means of a direct physical contact between the link and the constraint, users can feel a hard virtual surface. This paper describes the principle and the implementation of the proposed co-actuation module. Performance evaluation was conducted using a two-DOF haptic device in a task workspace of 100 mm × 100 mm. The effective inertia of the device is 64-142 g within the task workspace. The device can stably render a virtual wall with stiffness as high as 65 N/mm. The penetration to the virtual wall was 0.02-0.41 mm when tapping the wall with a speed range of 80-320 mm/s. The maximum back driving force was about 0.19 N when moving within 4.5-8.6 mm/s. The experimental results demonstrate that the concept of co-actuation is feasible in achieving high force, high stiffness range and low inertia for haptic devices.

- (2020) Admittance-Based Controller Design for Physical Human–Robot Interaction in the Constrained Task Space, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2020.2983225.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptive neural network (NN) control; Admittance; admittance control; Human-robot interaction; integral barrier Lyapunov function (IBLF); Lyapunov methods; Manipulator dynamics; motion constraint; Neural networks; physical human–robot interaction (pHRI); Service robots.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, an admittance-based controller for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is presented to perform the coordinated operation in the constrained task space. An admittance model and a soft saturation function are employed to generate a differentiable reference trajectory to ensure that the end-effector motion of the manipulator complies with the human operation and avoids collision with surroundings. Then, an adaptive neural network (NN) controller involving integral barrier Lyapunov function (IBLF) is designed to deal with tracking issues. Meanwhile, the controller can guarantee the end-effector of the manipulator limited in the constrained task space. A learning method based on the radial basis function NN (RBFNN) is involved in controller design to compensate for the dynamic uncertainties and improve tracking performance. The IBLF method is provided to prevent violations of the constrained task space. We prove that all states of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) by utilizing the Lyapunov stability principles. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on a Baxter robot experiment platform. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by the neglect of safety in existing controller design in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), which exists in industry and services, such as assembly and medical care. It is considerably required in the controller design for rigorously handling constraints. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel admittance-based human-robot interaction controller. The developed controller has the following functionalities: 1) ensuring reference trajectory remaining in the constrained task space: a differentiable reference trajectory is shaped by the desired admittance model and a soft saturation function; 2) solving uncertainties of robotic dynamics: a learning approach based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is involved in controller design; and 3) ensuring the end-effector of the manipulator remaining in the constrained task space: different from other barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), integral BLF (IBLF) is proposed to constrain system output directly rather than tracking error, which may be more convenient for controller designers. The controller can be potentially applied in many areas. First, it can be used in the rehabilitation robot to avoid injuring the patient by limiting the motion. Second, it can ensure the end-effector of the industrial manipulator in a prescribed task region. In some industrial tasks, dangerous or damageable tools are mounted on the end-effector, and it will hurt humans and bring damage to the robot when the end-effector is out of the prescribed task region. Third, it may bring a new idea to the designed controller for avoiding collisions in pHRI when collisions occur in the prescribed trajectory of end-effector.

**Abstract**: In the literature, Bode plots and Nyquist diagrams are used extensively in stability analysis for admittance-based models. In this letter, we demonstrate that eigenvalues obtained from the total admittance lead to accurate prediction of stability while Bode plots and Nyquist diagrams show limitations. A voltage source converter with weak grid interconnection is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the pros and cons of the three methods applied to dq-frame admittance matrices.

**Keywords**: DC–AC converter; electric machine; Electric machines; Emulation; emulator; Impedance; impedance regulation; Mathematical model; Maximum likelihood detection; Nonlinear filters; Regulators; testing.<br>
**Abstract**: Power-electronics-based emulators have been showing promising prospects in advanced testing of various applications of power electronics systems. For electric machine applications, typical machine emulators calculate the references of stator current in response to terminal voltages via mathematical models of the machine system, and then, the current behaviors of emulators are regulated by using feedback controls. However, the dynamic and high-frequency performances of these machine emulators could be distorted by the introduced control loops, thus compromising the emulating performances. In this article, the limits of typical machine emulators are analyzed, and a new approach is proposed for the real-time emulation of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM). A linear regulator without feedback control loop is proposed and designed to reshape the frequency-domain characteristics of the converter and current filter inside the emulation system. Compared with typical solutions, the proposed approach has frequency-domain characteristics closer to the target PMSM. The dynamic performances can be more accurately recreated, and the applicable frequency range for emulation can be extended. Simulations and experimental validations are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Abstract**: The control of a robot in its task space is a standard approach nowadays. If the system is kinematically redundant with respect to this goal, one can even execute additional subtasks simultaneously. By utilizing null space projections, for example, the whole stack of tasks can be implemented within a strict task hierarchy following the order of priority. One of the most common methods to track multiple task-space trajectories at the same time is to feedback-linearize the system and dynamically decouple all involved subtasks, which finally yields the exponential stability of the desired equilibrium. In this article, we provide a hierarchical multi-objective controller for trajectory tracking that ensures both asymptotic stability of the equilibrium and a desired contact impedance at the same time. In contrast to the state of the art in prioritized multi-objective control, feedback of the external forces can be avoided and the natural inertia of the robot is preserved. The controller is evaluated in simulations and on a standard lightweight robot with torque interface. The approach is predestined for precise trajectory tracking where dedicated and robust physical-interaction compliance is crucial at the same time.

- (2020) A Robust Impedance Controller Design for Series Elastic Actuators using the Singular Perturbation Theory, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2951417.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Bandwidth; End effectors; Human-robot interaction; Impedance; impedance control; series elastic actuator (SEA); singular perturbation; System dynamics; time-delay estimation (TDE).<br>
**Abstract**: Impedance control is capable of further flexibly adjusting the driving-point impedance of series elastic actuators (SEAs) in conjunction with impedance reduction by the elastic element. This feature enhances safety and compliance during interaction between humans and robots, in comparison with rigid robots under impedance control or SEAs under position control. In this article, we propose an impedance controller for SEA systems that are developed based on the singular perturbation (SP) theory and time-delay estimation (TDE) technique. The SP theory allows for alleviating the burden of the requirement for states to be measured. The TDE technique is effective in compensating for system dynamics and uncertainties involved in system behaviors with minute computation loads. Employing both a simulation study and experimental study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control created from the combination of the SP theory and TDE technique. The effect of the proposed impedance control on broadening operational bandwidth while providing lower driving-point impedance is investigated.

- (2020) Design and Force-Tracking Impedance Control of 2-DOF Wall-Cleaning Manipulator via Disturbance Observer, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2020.2978251.<br>
**Keywords**: Brushes; Cleaning; Disturbance observer (DOB); Force; force-tracking; Impedance; impedance control; Manipulator dynamics; wall-cleaning.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents the design and force-tracking impedance control (FTIC) of a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) wall-cleaning manipulator. A novel 2-DOF wall-cleaning manipulator is designed not only to keep in good contact with different shapes of walls but also to avoid various obstacles on walls efficiently. By adopting two ball screws, 2-DOF motions of the manipulator, such as translation of 150 mm and tilting within ±13°, are achieved successfully. Also, the position-based FTIC is derived to enable the proposed manipulator to not only interact with walls in a desired impedance behavior but also maintain a desired contact force. The FTIC consists of a positionbased impedance control (PIC) and a disturbance observer (DOB). While the PIC ensures the excellent force-tracking capability of the proposed manipulator in the steady state, the DOB is adopted to enhance its transient response, i.e., to effectively reject the disturbances caused by the various shapes of walls. The extensive experiments using the test bench equipped with the FTIC demonstrate that the proposed manipulator can maintain the desired contact force within ±4.5 N against the varying shapes of walls and the different types of roller brushes.

**Keywords**: Admittance; Dual-loop; global admittance; Harmonic analysis; harmonic control strategy; multimodule; Power harmonic filters; Redundancy; stability analysis; Stability analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: A large-capacity harmonic current widely exists in low-voltage distribution networks, which seriously affects the operation reliability and the efficiency of power system and related equipment. Due to its excellent controllability and dynamic response performance, the full-controlled semiconductor-device-based multimodular shunt active power filter is considered as the optimal choice to compensate the distorted current from large-scale nonlinear loads. However, due to the increase of parallel modules, comprehensive compensation performance needs to be improved and the system stability analysis is required. In this article, based on the comprehensive comparison and the analysis of the traditional parallel operation, a novel dual-loop-based harmonic control strategy that features the comprehensive filtering performance through combining feedforward power splitting and feedback frequency splitting control is proposed, which realizes a comprehensive optimization of capacity utilization, compensation precision, and dynamic response performance. In addition, for the system stability analysis, by establishing the two-port Norton equivalent circuit of a multi-inverter parallel system in the admittance form, the response expressions of each part of parallel system are obtained, and the essential reason for the instability is revealed from the perspective of the frequency-domain characteristics of global admittance. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to support the reasonability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

- (2020) Relative Impedance-Based Internal Force Control for Bimanual Robot Teleoperation With Varying Time Delay, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIE.2019.2907446.<br>
**Keywords**: Delay effects; Force; Force control; Impedance; Internal haptic forces; linear matrix inequalities (LMIs); relative impedance; Robot sensing systems; teleoperation; time delay; Tracking.<br>
**Abstract**: For a bimanual robot teleoperation system, the internal forces affecting the common deformable manipulation object are determined by both robot arms' actions. F/T sensorless, uncertain dynamics, and varying time delays increase dramatically the control difficulty for system stability and transparency. To address these problems, an internal force control method based on relative impedance is proposed in this paper. First, we deduce the desired positions to decrease internal force tracking errors and abstract the internal force from the product of the relative distance and impedance. Second, two strategies are adopted for reducing internal force tracking errors and motion synchronization. One is designing an adaptive factor to switch authorities for position control and internal force control. The other is proposing a force estimating method to the coupled item of uncertain dynamics, disturbance, and internal forces. Different parts of the coupled item are divided and solved separately by nonlinear characters. An integral sliding surface based on the relative impedance item is designed to minimize the force tracking errors. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by linear matrix inequalities based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional synthesis, and an experiment based on a physical robot system is implemented to validate the proposed method.

- (2020) Passivity Preservation for Variable Impedance Control of Compliant Robots, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2019.2961478.<br>
**Keywords**: Damping; Human-robot interaction; Impedance; impedance control; manipulators; Modulation; Robots; Stability analysis; Task analysis; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: The notable performance exhibited by impedance controllers during robotic interaction has led to the widespread use of this control methodology. Improved position and interaction control might be attainable through utilisation of variable impedance control (VIC) techniques. Interactional performance could be further improved by combining structural compliance with VIC. However, utilization of VIC tends to induce energy-injecting elements, which could impact on a robotic system's stability/passivity. Additionally, implementation of active VIC techniques on passively compliant robots has not been investigated (although several works consider VIC using variable stiffness actuators), which renders the existing rigid-joint robot, passivity-inducing control schemes inapplicable to compliant systems. To this end, the work presented here introduces a novel scheme, termed passivity-preservation control (PPC), which suppresses the energy injections that could be introduced into compliant robots, as a result of VIC. Compared to tank-based VIC approaches the PPC scheme is directly applicable to flexible-joint robots, even ones with nonlinear passive stiffness elements, while its performance is independent of the tank-energy levels. Moreover, the proposed scheme permits stable VIC using full-state feedback, thereby enabling impedance modulations relating to both motor and link-side variables. Consequently, full-state feedback gains can be generated via linear quadratic regulator optimisation, thus enabling application of gain-scheduling techniques on flexible-joint robots for enhanced position control. Passivity and stability analyses are performed for joint and Cartesian-space versions of the PPC scheme, which justify their applicability to both interaction and “free-motion” scenarios. The PPC scheme's efficacy, compared to constant gain impedance methods, in terms of convergence and interactional performance, is corroborated via simulation and experimental means involving the Sawyer robot, which is powered by series elastic actuators. Theoretical and experimental results mathematically and practically verify VIC stability, thus enabling flexible-joint robots to more accurately mimic biologically inspired behaviors.

- (2020) A Complex Stiffness Human Impedance Model With Customizable Exoskeleton Control, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3027501.<br>
**Keywords**: Damping; Elbow; exoskeletons; Exoskeletons; Gravity; Human impedance; human performance augmentation; Impedance; Springs; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: The natural impedance, or dynamic relationship between force and motion, of a human operator can determine the stability of exoskeletons that use interaction-torque feedback to amplify human strength. While human impedance is typically modelled as a linear system, our experiments on a single-joint exoskeleton testbed involving 10 human subjects show evidence of nonlinear behavior: a low-frequency asymptotic phase for the dynamic stiffness of the human that is different than the expected zero, and an unexpectedly consistent damping ratio as the stiffness and inertia vary. To explain these observations, this article considers a new frequency-domain model of the human joint dynamics featuring complex value stiffness comprising a real stiffness term and a hysteretic damping term. Using a statistical F-test we show that the hysteretic damping term is not only significant but is even more significant than the linear damping term. Further analysis reveals a linear trend linking hysteretic damping and the real part of the stiffness, which allows us to simplify the complex stiffness model down to a 1-parameter system. Then, we introduce and demonstrate a customizable fractional-order controller that exploits this hysteretic damping behavior to improve strength amplification bandwidth while maintaining stability, and explore a tuning approach which ensures that this stability property is robust to muscle co-contraction for each individual.

**Keywords**: adaptive robust control; Exoskeletons; Force; human-robot interaction; Impedance; Impedance control; Manipulators; Muscles; robotic exoskeleton; stiffness identification; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Humans can adapt to complex environments by voluntarily adjusting the impedance parameters and interaction force. Traditional robots perform tasks independently without considering their interactions with the external environment, which leads to poor flexibility and adaptability. Comparatively, humans can adapt to complex environments by voluntarily adjusting the impedance parameters and interaction force. In order to solve the problems of human-robot security and adaptability to unknown environment, a human-inspired control with force and impedance adaptation is proposed to interact with unknown environments and exhibit this biological behavior on the developed dual-arm exoskeleton robots. First, we propose a computationally model utilizing the sampled surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals to calculate the human arm endpoint stiffness and define a co-contraction index to describe the dynamic behaviors of the muscular activities in the tasks. Then, the obtained human limb impedance stiffness parameters and the sampling position information are transferred to the slave arm of the exoskeleton as the input variables of the controller in real-time. In addition, a variable stiffness observer is used here to compensate for the errors of the calculated stiffness by sEMG signals. The experimental studies of human impedance transfer control have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the developed approach. Results of the experimental suggest that the proposed controller can achieve human motor adaptation and enable the subjects to execute a skill transfer control by a dual-arm exoskeleton robot.

- (2020) Ankle Mechanical Impedance During the Stance Phase of Running, **in** *IEEE. Trans. Biomed. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TBME.2019.2940927.<br>
**Keywords**: biological system modeling; Biomechanics; Foot; Gait analysis; Impedance; legged locomotion; Legged locomotion; Perturbation methods; system identification; Task analysis; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: Objective: Differences in locomotor biomechanics between walking and running provide fundamental information about human ambulation. Joint mechanical impedance is a biomechanical property that governs the body's instantaneous response to disturbances, and is important for stability and energy transfer. Ankle impedance has been characterized during walking, but little is known about how humans alter joint impedance during running. The purpose of this study was to estimate ankle impedance during the stance phase of running, and compare to previously reported estimates during walking. Methods: Perturbations were applied to the ankle using a one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechatronic platform. Least-squares system identification was performed using a parametric model consisting of stiffness, damping, and inertia. Results: The model accounted for 89% ± 16% of variance. Ankle stiffness reached a maximum of 10 Nm/rad/kg at the end of mid-stance, decreasing in terminal stance phase to values previously reported during swing phase. Quasi-stiffness values differed significantly from stiffness across the stance phase of running. Comparing ankle impedance estimates between walking and running showed differences in both magnitude, and temporal variation. Conclusion: Ankle impedance differs significantly between walking and running. Significance: This study provides novel information about the biomechanics of running and broadens our understanding of how the mechanical impedance of the ankle joint differs between locomotor tasks, motivating the need for future studies.

- (2020) A Learning-Based Hierarchical Control Scheme for an Exoskeleton Robot in Human–Robot Cooperative Manipulation, **in** *IEEE T. Cybern.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCYB.2018.2864784.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (ABLF); exoskeleton robot; Exoskeletons; Force; Gaussian mixture; Hidden Markov models; human–robot cooperative manipulation; impedance-based task; learning human skills from demonstration; Nonlinear systems; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Exoskeleton robots can assist humans to perform activities of daily living with little effort. In this paper, a hierarchical control scheme is presented which enables an exoskeleton robot to achieve cooperative manipulation with humans. The control scheme consists of two layers. In lowlevel control of the upper limb exoskeleton robot, an admittance control scheme with an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function-based adaptive neural network controller is proposed to enable the robot to be back drivable. In order to achieve high-level interaction, a strategy for learning human skills from demonstration is proposed by utilizing Gaussian mixture models, which consists of the learning and reproduction phase. During the learning phase, the robot observes and learns how a demonstrator performs a specific impedance-based task successfully, and in the reproduction phase, the robot can provide the subjects with just enough assistance by extracting human skills from demonstrations to prevent the motion of the robot end-effector deviating far from desired ones, due to variation in the interaction force caused by environmental disturbances. Experimental results of two different tasks show that the proposed control scheme can provide human subjects with assistance as needed during cooperative manipulation.

- (2020) Operational Space Model Predictive Sliding Mode Control for Redundant Manipulators, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2020.2974092.<br>
**Keywords**: Aerospace electronics; Compliance and impedance control; Impedance; Manifolds; Manipulators; motion control of manipulators; optimization and optimal control; redundant robots; robust/adaptive control of robotic systems; Robustness; sliding mode control (SMC); Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a novel robust centralized controller for impedance control and reference tracking of redundant manipulators. The proposed approach takes advantage of the robustness properties of sliding mode control (SMC) and the prediction capabilities of model predictive control (MPC). SMC theory is employed to compensate unmodeled system dynamics and disturbances, ensuring accurate tracking and enforcement of a desired end-point impedance during interaction with the environment. Differently from other schemes, the sliding manifold is expressed directly in the task space and the approach is generalized to redundant manipulators by projection of the manifolds into joint space. Chattering attenuation is provided by a second-order integral sliding mode control law. These features are exploited by the MPC to guarantee motion and actuation constraint fulfillment based on the nominal feedback linearized robot model. A formal analysis of the control system is given along with the relevant proofs. The resulting model predictive sliding mode controller is able to cope with delays acting on the control input torque. The effectiveness of the approach is validated in simulation on a 4-DOF planar robot, and its viability on real platforms through experiments on a 7-DOF prototype ABB YuMi robot arm.

- (2020) Design and Validation of a Powered Knee–Ankle Prosthesis With High-Torque, Low-Impedance Actuators, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2020.3005533.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuator design; Actuators; backdrivability; Impedance; Legged locomotion; powered prostheses; Prosthetics; rehabilitation robotics; Rehabilitation robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, we present the design of a powered knee-ankle prosthetic leg, which implements high-torque actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible benefits over modern actuation styles in emerging robotic prosthetic legs, which include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, less acoustic noise, and power regeneration. Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques ($\sim$1-3 N$\cdot$m) and confirm the small reflected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufficiently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. Finally, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reflected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power consumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-the-art powered legs.

- (2020) Estimating an LPV Model of Driver Neuromuscular Admittance Using Grip Force as Scheduling Variable, **in** *IEEE T. Hum.-Mach. Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/THMS.2020.2989685.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Computational modeling; Driving behavior; Force; grip force; linear parameter-varying (LPV) models; Linear systems; neuromuscular admittance; Perturbation methods; Task analysis; Vehicles.<br>
**Abstract**: Humans can rapidly change their low-frequency arm dynamics to resist forces or give way to them. Quantifying driver time-varying arm dynamics is important to develop steer-by-wire and haptic support systems. Conventional linear time-invariant (LTI) identification, and even time-varying techniques such as wavelets, fail to capture fast changing dynamics. Moreover, such techniques require perturbation signals on the steering wheel (SW), which may affect steering feel and control behavior. We propose a novel two-step method to estimate time-varying driver admittance, using unobtrusive grip-force measurements of the hands on the wheel to schedule a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model that captures the full admittance range. A total of 18 subjects participated in two experiments in a simulator with an actuated SW. In a sensorimotor control experiment, we first establish the grip force and admittance relationship, requiring subjects to perform a boundary tracking task where perturbations on the wheel enabled local LTI identification. Six boundary widths is used to evoke admittance changes, after which a global LPV model is obtained through interpolation between the local models. Results show an inverse relationship between grip force and admittance and that the LPV model accurately captures the admittance settings (fit percentage > 90%). Second, a driving experiment is followed that aims to evoke differences in grip force and admittance in response to varying road widths, offering more realistic data to evaluate the LPV model predictions. Results show that the LPV model accurately describes adaptations in admittance to road width. Our method allows for online estimation of time-varying admittance during driving, without applying force perturbations.

- (2020) Revealing Time-Varying Joint Impedance With Kernel-Based Regression and Nonparametric Decomposition, **in** *IEEE Trans. Control Syst. Technol.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCST.2018.2881664.<br>
**Keywords**: Differential equations; Frequency-domain analysis; Human motor control; Impedance; joint impedance; Mathematical model; Muscles; Perturbation methods; system identification (SI); time-varying systems; Time-varying systems.<br>
**Abstract**: During movements, humans continuously regulate their joint impedance to minimize control effort and optimize performance. Joint impedance describes the relationship between a joint's position and torque acting around the joint. Joint impedance varies with joint angle and muscle activation and differs from trial-to-trial due to inherent variability in the human control system. In this paper, a dedicated time-varying system identification (SI) framework is developed involving a parametric, kernel-based regression, and nonparametric, “skirt decomposition,” SI method to monitor the time-varying joint impedance during a force task. Identification was performed on single trials and the estimators included little a priori assumptions regarding the underlying time-varying joint mechanics. During the experiments, six (human) participants used flexion of the wrist to apply a slow sinusoidal torque to the handle of a robotic manipulator, while receiving small position perturbations. Both methods revealed that the sinusoidal change in joint torque by activation of the wrist flexor muscles resulted in a sinusoidal time-varying joint stiffness and resonance frequency. A third-order differential equation allowed the parametric kernel-based estimator to explain on average 76% of the variance (range 52%-90%). The nonparametric skirt decomposition method could explain on average 84% of the variance (range 66%-91%). This paper presents a novel framework for identification of time-varying joint impedance by making use of linear time-varying models based on a single trial of data.

- (2020) A Control Scheme for Smooth Transition in Physical Human-Robot-Environment Between Two Modes: Augmentation and Autonomous, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2020.3010450.<br>
**Keywords**: adaptive position/velocity control; Admittance; Force; Force control; Human-robot collaboration; Impedance; impedance/admittance control; Robot sensing systems.<br>
**Abstract**: There has been an increasing demand for physical human-robot collaboration during the design prototyping phase. For example, users would like to maneuver the end-effector compliantly in free space followed by supplying a contact force to obtain a firm adhesive connection. The technical challenges is the design of the controller, especially during the switching from human-robot interaction (human guides robot) to robot-environment interaction for the robot to continuously maintain the contact force even after the human lets go. Traditional controllers often result in unstable interaction during the switches of the controllers. Therefore, this letter proposes a control scheme that unifies impedance and admittance in the outer loop, and unifies the adaptive position and velocity control in the inner loop to address this issue. The cooperation of the cobot is divided into two modes, namely, an augmentation mode where the human force is the desired input to guide the motion of the cobot, and an autonomous mode where predefined position and force commands are used (e.g., to maintain a desired holding force). With the proposed control scheme, the physical interaction between the robot, human and environment can be smoothly and stably transited from augmentation mode to autonomous mode. Experiments are then conducted to validate the proposed approach.

**Keywords**: Admittance; admittance control; Aerospace electronics; collaboration; dynamic programing; Grasping; impact; Kinematics; motion planning; optimal control; Planning; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Cooperative grasping refers to the situation when an object is manipulated by multiple robots and the grasp is achieved by the unilateral contact between the robots and the object. This is different from the cooperation of multiple robots where each robot rigidly grasps the object. Motion planning of cooperative grasping tasks involves active force control of the interaction wrench in order to ensure stable grasp. This becomes particularly challenging when aiming at time optimal motions. It is crucial that the trajectories are continuous up to third-order, in order to satisfy velocity, acceleration, and jerk as well as torque limits of the robots. A solution approach is presented for the time optimal path following of two robots performing cooperative grasping tasks. The time optimal path is determined with a dynamic programming method. An admittance control scheme in task space is proposed and used to generate the contact wrench. The method is applicable to.

**Keywords**: Aerospace electronics; compliance and impedance control; Impedance; motion control; PD control; Reinforcement learning; Robots; Robustness; Task analysis; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning algorithms have shown great success in solving different problems ranging from playing video games to robotics. However, they struggle to solve delicate robotic problems, especially those involving contact interactions. Though in principle a policy directly outputting joint torques should be able to learn to perform these tasks, in practice we see that it has difficulty to robustly solve the problem without any given structure in the action space. In this letter, we investigate how the choice of action space can give robust performance in presence of contact uncertainties. We propose learning a policy giving as output impedance and desired position in joint space and compare the performance of that approach to torque and position control under different contact uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose an additional reward term designed to regularize these variable impedance control policies, giving them interpretability and facilitating their transfer to real systems. We present extensive experiments in simulation of both floating and fixed-base systems in tasks involving contact uncertainties, as well as results for running the learned policies on a real system (accompanying videos can be seen here: https://youtu.be/AQuuQ-h4dBM).

- (2020) A Clustering-Based Approach to Identify Joint Impedance During Walking, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3005389.<br>
**Keywords**: clustering; Estimation; Impedance; Joint mechanical impedance; Kinematics; Legged locomotion; machine learning; Muscles; Perturbation methods; Torque; weighted least squares.<br>
**Abstract**: Mechanical impedance, which changes with posture and muscle activations, characterizes how the central nervous system regulates the interaction with the environment. Traditional approaches to impedance estimation, based on averaging of movement kinetics, requires a large number of trials and may introduce bias to the estimation due to the high variability in a repeated or periodic movement. Here, we introduce a data-driven modeling technique to estimate joint impedance considering the large gait variability. The proposed method can be used to estimate impedance in both the stance and swing phases of walking. A 2-pass clustering approach is used to extract groups of unperturbed gait data and estimate candidate baselines. Then patterns of perturbed data are matched with the most similar unperturbed baseline. The kinematic and torque deviations from the baselines are regressed locally to compute joint impedance at different gait phases. Simulations using the trajectory data of a subject's gait at different speeds demonstrate a more accurate estimation of ankle stiffness and damping with the proposed clustering-based method when compared with two methods: i) using average unperturbed baselines, and ii) matching shifted and scaled average unperturbed velocity baselines. Furthermore, the proposed method requires fewer trials than methods based on average unperturbed baselines. The experimental results on human hip impedance estimation show the feasibility of clustering-based technique and verifies that it reduces the estimation variability.

**Keywords**: Bone drilling simulation; Bones; Feedback; Force; haptic augmentation; Haptic interfaces; motor skill training.; Orthopedic surgery; Training; vibrotactile feedback; Virtual reality.<br>
**Abstract**: Haptic feedback in virtual reality-based trainers for surgical bone drilling is mostly provided via impedance-controlled haptic devices. Due to this, the displayable maximum stiffness is limited. In addition, vibration feedback is often only of reduced fidelity. To overcome these shortcomings, we have developed a hand-held, actuated admittance-controlled drill mockup, comprising enhanced kinesthetic and tactile feedback. This article reports on design and characterization of the device, and highlights its use for training. Kinesthetic feedback is provided through haptic augmentation, employing a ball-screw mechanism acting on a retractable drill-bit. Feedback computation relies on admittance control, thus allowing for stable display of very high resistance forces, and thus material stiffness, which cannot be achieved with standard impedance-control approaches. For the tactile mechanism, a modified linear vibration actuator is directly attached to the mockup handle, improving signal transmission. Tactile feedback computation is based on an extension of a previously proposed power spectral density control method. Frequency-specific gains are adjusted in real-time, compensating for differences between desired and measured vibrations. The performance of the device is characterized in several experiments, including comparisons to drilling with a real drill into artificial bone samples. In addition, several user studies have been carried out. We illustrate the capability of the mockup to render bone samples with different material layer stiffness and thickness. Moreover, we show that the mockup system allows for the same training effect as when rehearsing with a real drill.

**Keywords**: compliance and impedance control; Dexterous manipulation; Force; Friction; grasping; Grasping; Impedance; Jacobian matrices; Robot kinematics.<br>
**Abstract**: This work presents a novel object-level control framework for the dexterous in-hand manipulation of objects with torque-controlled robotic hands. The proposed impedance-based controller realizes the compliant 6-DOF positioning of a grasped object. Enabled by the in-hand localization, the slippage of contacts is avoided by actively maintaining the desired grasp configuration. The internal forces on the object are determined by solving a quadratic optimization problem, which explicitly considers friction constraints on the contacts and allows to gradually shift the load between fingers. The proposed framework is capable of dealing with dynamic changes in the grasp configuration, which makes it applicable for the control of the object during grasp acquisition or the reconfiguration of fingers (i.e. finger gaiting). A nullspace controller avoids joint limits and singularities. Experiments with the DLR robot David demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the controller in various grasping scenarios.

**Keywords**: Actuators; Impedance; Impedance control; lower limb robot; physical human???robot interaction (pHRI); Prototypes; Robots; Task analysis; Torque; torque control; Torque control; variable stiffness actuator (VSA).<br>
**Abstract**: We present a novel application of the variable stiffness actuator (VSA)-based assistance/rehabilitation robot-featured impedance control using a cascaded position torque control loop. The robot follows the adaptive impedance control paradigm, thereby achieving an adaptive assistance level according to human joint torque. The feedforward human joint torque command is used to cooperatively adjust the impedance controller and the stiffness trajectory of the VSA (this functional architecture is referred to as the cooperative control framework). In this way, the task performance during movement training can be improved regarding: 1) safety-for example, when the subject intends to contribute considerable effort, low-gain impedance control is activated with a low stiffness actuator to further decrease output impedance and 2) tracking performance-for example, for the subject with less effort, high-gain impedance control is used while pursuing high stiffness to enhance the torque bandwidth. Regarding the safety aspect, we demonstrate that the torque controller designed at low stiffness can be sensitive to the disturbance for low output impedance while maintaining tracking performance. A precondition for this is to treat the input disturbance separately. This is guaranteed by our previously proposed torque control of the VSA using the linear quadratic Gaussian technique. This approach is also employed here, but with additional discussion on the observer design to serve the proposed cooperative control approach. Here, the effectiveness of the proposed control system is experimentally verified using a VSA prototype and a one-degree-of-freedom lower limb exoskeleton worn by a human test person. Note to Practitioners-Control of “physical human-robot interaction” can be achieved by the mechanical parts of the variable stiffness actuator (VSA). However, the mechanical construction for stiffness variation may limit the capacity to achieve low output stiffness and fast stiffness variation in speed. These limitations may become more evident in the assistance/rehabilitation robot applications. To overcome these limitations, the impedance control scheme can be employed to achieve a programmable impedance range and impedance variation speed. This control scheme has been widely applied on the fixed-compliance joint but lacks a way to be implemented on the VSA joint because of its existing capacity to control the impedance with the mechanical construction. This article presents a novel application of the impedance-controlled VSA used on a lower limb robot. We describe how to adjust the actuator stiffness to cooperatively work with the adaptive impedance control scheme. Based on our approach, the robot with the impedance-controlled VSA joint can extend the capacity of bandwidth and low output impedance. This is an improvement on the impedance-controlled fixed-compliance joint. The cooperative control framework presented here was tested on an exoskeleton system with two healthy test persons and is also applicable to other actuator prototypes. Future research aims to employ this system for actual patient training.

- (2020) Energy Regenerative Damping in Variable Impedance Actuators for Long-Term Robotic Deployment, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2020.2998641.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; compliance and impedance control; Compliant joint/mechanism; Damping; energy and environment-aware automation; Energy consumption; energy efficient actuation and control; Impedance; Manufacturing automation.<br>
**Abstract**: Energy efficiency is a crucial issue towards long-term deployment of compliant robots in the real world. In the context of variable impedance actuators (VIAs), one of the main focuses has been on improving energy efficiency through reduction of energy consumption. However, the harvesting of dissipated energy in such systems remains under-explored. This study proposes a variable damping module design enabling energy regeneration in VIAs by exploiting the regenerative braking effect of dc motors. The proposed damping module uses four switches to combine regenerative and dynamic braking, in a hybrid approach that enables energy regeneration without a reduction in the range of damping achievable. A physical implementation on a simple VIA mechanism is presented in which the regenerative properties of the proposed module are characterized and compared against theoretical predictions. To investigate the role of variable regenerative damping in terms of energy efficiency of long-term operation, experiments are reported in which the VIA, equipped with the proposed damping module, performs sequential reaching to a series of stochastic targets. The results indicate that the combination of variable stiffness and variable regenerative damping results in a 25% performance improvement on metrics incorporating reaching accuracy, settling time, energy consumption and regeneration over comparable schemes, where either stiffness or damping are fixed.

- (2020) Nonlinear Hybrid Impedance Control for Steering Control of Rack-Mounted Electric Power Steering in Autonomous Vehicles, **in** *IEEE Trans. Intell. Transp. Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TITS.2019.2921893.<br>
**Keywords**: Autonomous vehicles; electric power steering (EPS) system; Fasteners; Impedance; Shafts; sliding mode control; Torque; Wheels.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, we present an innovative approach to steering control, based on torque overlay, for the smooth and efficient transfer of the steering control from an autonomous driving system to the driver, and to control the pinion angle of the rack-mounted electric power steering for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. The novelty of our approach lies in the formulation of hybrid impedance control, which employs steering control for both lateral and impedance controls. The proposed method, nonlinear hybrid impedance controller, consists of desired impedance pinion angle generator and a super-twisting sliding mode controller for pinion angle tracking. The desired impedance transfer function of the driver's torque to the steering wheel angle reflects the driver's torque to the steering control. The desired impedance pinion angle is generated using the desired impedance transfer function and the desired pinion angle derived by the lateral controller. The sliding mode control method is designed, based on a super-twisting algorithm for the pinion angle, to track the desired impedance pinion angle. Consequently, without the driver's torque, the proposed method is activated as a pinion angle tracking controller for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. Moreover, with the driver's torque, the proposed method is activated as an impedance controller.

- (2020) Multi-Directional Ankle Impedance During Standing Postures, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3018650.<br>
**Keywords**: ankle neuromuscular characteristics; Biomechanics; Damping; Foot; Force; human ankle; Impedance; Legged locomotion; multi-directional ankle impedance; Perturbation methods; standing posture; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: In this study, we estimated the multi-directional ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) during standing, and determined how the stiffness, damping, and inertia vary with ankle angle and ankle torque at different postures. Fifteen subjects stood on a vibrating instrumented platform in four stationary postures, while subjected to pulse train perturbations in both the sagittal and frontal planes of motion. The four stationary postures were selected to resemble stages within the stance phase of the gait cycle: including post-heel-strike during the loading response, mid-stance, post-mid-stance, and just before the heel rises from the ground in terminal-stance phase. In general, the ankle stiffness and damping increased in all directions as the foot COP moved forward, and more torque is generated in plantarflexion. Interestingly, the multi-directional ankle impedance during standing showed a similar shape and major tilt axes to the results of non-loaded scenarios. However, there were notable differences in the impedance amplitude when the ankle was not under bodyweight loading. Last, the stiffness during standing had similar amplitudes ranges to the time-varying ankle stiffness during the stance phase of dynamic walking estimated in previous studies. These results have implications on the design of new, less physically intense, biomechanics experiments aimed at people with neuromuscular disorders or other physical impairments who cannot complete a standard gait test.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive systems; Impedance; Impedance control; input saturation; Manipulators; nonlinear uncertain system; Robot sensing systems; robust adaptive control; Robustness.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper develops a robust adaptive model reference impedance controller for an n-link robotic manipulator with parameter uncertainties, actuator saturation, and imprecise force sensor measurement. In order to handle the system uncertainties, the adaptive technique and prediction error are used. To reduce calculation complexity, the adaptation law for robot parameters estimation is designed in the joint space. Actuator saturation is also overcome by an auxiliary system, and imprecise force sensor measurement is compensated with utilization of adaptive bounding technique. Moreover, the joint acceleration vector problem, which is nonmeasurable, is covered by the filtered regressor matrix. Using Lyapunov's direct method, as long as two conditions are satisfied the proposed controller ensures the exponential stability of all the signals of the closed loop system; otherwise, the closed loop system is globally stable. Finally, simulations are performed on prototyped robots to analyze and evaluate the established controller as well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

- (2021) HapFIC: An Adaptive Force/Position Controller for Safe Environment Interaction in Articulated Systems, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3098062.<br>
**Keywords**: Impedance;Haptic interfaces;Robots;Force;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems;Fractals;Haptics;force;position control;human-robot interaction.<br>
**Abstract**: Haptic interaction is essential for the dynamic dexterity of animals, which seamlessly switch from an impedance to an admittance behaviour using the force feedback from their proprioception. However, this ability is extremely challenging to reproduce in robots, especially when dealing with complex interaction dynamics, distributed contacts, and contact switching. Current model-based controllers require accurate interaction modelling to account for contacts and stabilise the interaction. In this manuscript, we propose an adaptive force/position controller that exploits the fractal impedance controller's passivity and non-linearity to execute a finite search algorithm using the force feedback signal from the sensor at the end-effector. The method is computationally inexpensive, opening the possibility to deal with distributed contacts in the future. We evaluated the architecture in physics simulation and showed that the controller can robustly control the interaction with objects of different dynamics without violating the maximum allowable target forces or causing numerical instability even for very rigid objects. The proposed controller can also autonomously deal with contact switching and may find application in multiple fields such as legged locomotion, rehabilitation and assistive robotics.

- (2021) Compliant Force Sensor-Less Capture of an Object in Orbit, **in** *IEEE Trans. Aerosp. Electron. Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TAES.2020.3027108.<br>
**Keywords**: Compliant capture; Force; Impedance; impedance control; Manipulators; Orbits; Satellites; space robot; Space vehicles.<br>
**Abstract**: Space robots have been proposed to perform several tasks in orbit, such as repairing, refueling, and assembly. All those activities require the robot to interact with external objects in a safe and compliant form to avoid high impact forces that may damage the robot's components or the object to manipulate. Impedance controllers have demonstrated to be a suitable approach to perform similar tasks in ground. Therefore, implementing and analyzing impedance-based techniques in space is also worthy of study. Not only that, but also, methods that can reduce the number of components, weight and complexity should be considered. This article proposes the use of the disturbance observer for the design of an impedance controller to perform a safe capture of a target satellite by a space robot. First, the observer aids in the determination of the contact force between the servicer and the target. Later, once the almost perfect match between the actual and estimated contact force is demonstrated, the estimated force is used as input for an impedance controller with trajectory tracking. The advantages of estimating the contact force instead of measuring it are also discussed in the document. The design of the impedance control is performed such that the capturing process is compliant and safe, and, thus, it can help to advance toward an autonomous capture of space objects. A simulation experiment was set up to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the contact force is bounded and behaves smoothly in a spring-mass-damper-like manner, imposing a stable contact between the robot's end effector and the servicer's capturing spot.

**Keywords**: Actuators; End effectors; Haptic interfaces; haptic robot; Impedance; Motor drives; neurological disorder; Robot kinematics; Robots; upper limb; User workspace.<br>
**Abstract**: Several studies have reported that stroke survivors displayed improved voluntary planar movements when forces supporting the upper limb increased, and when impeding forces decreased. Earlier haptic devices interacting with the human upper limb were potentially impacted by undesired residual friction force and device inertia. To explore natural, undisturbed voluntary motor control in stroke survivors, we describe the development of a Decoupled-Operational space Robot for wide Impedance Switching (DORIS) with minimized mechanical impedances. This design is based on a novel decoupling mechanism separating the end effector from a manipulator. While the user manipulates the end effector freely inside the workspace of the decoupling mechanism, to which a manipulator of the robot is attached, the robot detects such change in position using a lightweight linkage system. The manipulator of the robot then follows such movements of the end effector swiftly. Consequently, the user can explore the extended workspace, which can be as large as the manipulator's workspace. Since the end effector is mechanically decoupled from the manipulators and actuators, the user can remain unaffected by the mechanical impedances of the manipulator. Mechanical impedances perceived by the user and bandwidth of the control system were estimated. The developed robot was capable of detecting larger maximum acceleration and larger jerk of the reaching movement in chronic stroke survivors with hemiparesis. We propose that this device can be utilized for evaluating voluntary motor control of the upper limb while minimizing the impact of robot inertia and friction forces on limb behavior.

- (2021) A Testable Robust Stability Framework for the Variable Impedance Control of 1-DOF Exoskeleton With Variable Stiffness Actuator, **in** *IEEE Trans. Control Syst. Technol.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCST.2021.3051716.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Exoskeleton; Exoskeletons; Impedance; impedance control; linear parameter-varying (LPV) system; Robust stability; torque control; Torque control; variable stiffness actuator (VSA).<br>
**Abstract**: We present a framework for achieving a robust stability test of the variable stiffness actuator (VSA) exoskeleton programmed with the gain scheduling-based variable impedance control (GSVIC). In this brief, the focused impedance control framework involves the cascaded position torque control loop, in which both control loops are closed, and the index of the GSVIC is related to the joint torque of the human. However, there is a lack of research on the variation rate of such a biofeedback signal. This lack of information is necessary when performing the robust stability test of the linear parameter-varying (LPV) system. To acquire a bounded variation rate, the mechanical stiffness variation component of the VSA is used to transfer the biofeedback information into the GSVIC. In this case, the LPV system has only one variable parameter with the known and bounded variation rate, i.e., the physical stiffness of the VSA. The operating range of the impedance controller, determined from the test of robust stability via parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions, can meet our application requirements. The whole control system follows the paradigm of the variable impedance task in accordance with human intention. The effectiveness of the control scheme is experimentally verified on a VSA prototype and two subjects wearing the VSA exoskeleton.

- (2021) Optimized Impedance Adaptation of Robot Manipulator Interacting With Unknown Environment, **in** *IEEE Trans. Control Syst. Technol.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCST.2020.2971944.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP); Dynamics; Force; Impedance; Manipulator dynamics; optimized impedance adaptation; output feedback; robot–environment interaction; Trajectory; unknown environment.<br>
**Abstract**: In this brief, impedance adaptation is investigated for robots interacting with unknown environments, subject to unknown environment dynamics and position parameters. A cost function that measures the tracking error and interaction force is defined, and a complete state-space function considering the desired trajectory, environment dynamics, and position parameters is presented. The unknown environment dynamics and the unobservable environment position lead to unknown part of the system function as well as the system states in the complete system model. To this end, the output feedback adaptive dynamic programming (OPFB ADP) method is selected to realize the optimized impedance adaptation. Moreover, when considering the environment position/trajectory, the optimal impedance solution is difficult to obtain due to the existence of the arbitrary endpoint. An adaptive dynamic programming algorithm considering the trajectory tracking problem with arbitrary endpoint is proposed to deal with the problem. The convergence speed is accelerated by adding a discount factor. The validity of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experimental studies.

**Keywords**: Adaptive impedance control; Bayes methods; Bayesian estimation; Dynamics; Estimation; Force; human impedance; human motion intention estimation; Impedance; neural networks (NNs); Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes a Bayesian method to acquire the estimation of human impedance and motion intention in a human–robot collaborative task. Combining with the prior knowledge of human stiffness, estimated stiffness obeying Gaussian distribution is obtained by Bayesian estimation, and human motion intention can be also estimated. An adaptive impedance control strategy is employed to track a target impedance model and neural networks are used to compensate for uncertainties in robotic dynamics. Comparative simulation results are carried out to verify the effectiveness of estimation method and emphasize the advantages of the proposed control strategy. The experiment, performed on Baxter robot platform, illustrates a good system performance.

- (2021) Optimal Robot–Environment Interaction Under Broad Fuzzy Neural Adaptive Control, **in** *IEEE T. Cybern.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCYB.2020.2998984.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Artificial neural networks; Broad learning system (BLS); Fuzzy control; Fuzzy neural networks; fuzzy-logic control; Impedance; impedance adaptation; Manipulators; neural network (NN); state constraints.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes a novel control strategy based on a broad fuzzy neural network (BFNN) which is subjected to contact with the unknown environment. Compared with the conventional fuzzy neural network (NN), a prominent feature can be achieved by taking the advantage of the broad learning system (BLS) to explicitly tackle the problem of how to choose a sufficient number of NN units to approximate the unknown dynamic model. Aiming at providing a soft compliant contact scheme without the requirement of the environment model, an adaptive impedance learning is developed to establish the optimal interaction between the robot and the environment. Meanwhile, the problems related to the state constraints are addressed by incorporating a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) into the design of a trajectory tracking controller. The proposed method can achieve desired tracking and interaction performance while guaranteeing the stability of the closed-loop system. In addition, simulation and experimental studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of BFNN under optimal impedance control with a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator and a Baxter robot, respectively.

- (2021) Minimally Model-Based Trajectory Tracking and Variable Impedance Control of Flexible-Joint Robots, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIE.2020.2994886.<br>
**Keywords**: Flexible-joint robots; human–robot interaction; Impedance; impedance control; Modulation; Regulation; Robots; Task analysis; Torque; Trajectory tracking.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a novel control scheme that primarily provides a solution to the problem of simultaneously performing stable trajectory tracking and variable impedance control (VIC) of flexible-joint robots. The existing asymptotically stabilizing tracking controllers for compliant robots rely upon several model-based terms and their derivatives. Contrarily, the proposed minimally model-based trajectory tracking control scheme requires knowledge of only the gravitational torque vector model. Although interaction and tracking performance enhancements are achievable through VIC, its operation introduces energy injections, thereby impacting closed-loop stability/passivity. Existing VIC passivity preservation techniques deal exclusively with rigid-joint robots. To this end, the proposed method introduces the minimally model-based trajectory tracking variable impedance control scheme, which ensures passivity/stability when applying VIC to flexible-joint robots. Numerical and experimental results corroborate the controllers' efficacy in terms of realizing VIC interaction and tracking tasks, thus enabling flexible-joint robots to stably replicate biologically inspired behaviors.

**Keywords**: Adaptive impedance control; Force; Hidden Markov models; human–robot interaction systems; Impedance; Manipulators; multimodality; Muscles; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Transferring human stiffness regulation strategies to robots enables them to effectively and efficiently acquire adaptive impedance control policies to deal with uncertainties during the accomplishment of physical contact tasks in an unstructured environment. In this article, we develop such a physical human-robot interaction system which allows robots to learn variable impedance skills from human demonstrations. Specifically, the biological signals, i.e., surface electromyography are utilized for the extraction of human arm stiffness features during the task demonstration. The estimated human arm stiffness is then mapped into a robot impedance controller. The dynamics of both movement and stiffness are simultaneously modeled by using a model combining the hidden semi-Markov model and the Gaussian mixture regression. More importantly, the correlation between the movement information and the stiffness information is encoded in a systematic manner. This approach enables capturing uncertainties over time and space and allows the robot to satisfy both position and stiffness requirements in a task with modulation of the impedance controller. The experimental study validated the proposed approach.

**Keywords**: Bio-impedance; Biompedance; Electrical impedance tomography; electrical impedance tomography (EIT); electrodes; Electrodes; Gesture recognition; hand gesture recognition; Impedance measurement; measurements; Muscles; Wrist.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, we presented a bio-impedance analysis method (BIAM) based on the human hand anatomy and propose a feasible and flexible BIAM system to obtain the bio-impedance signals for different gestures to achieve a high classification accuracy in hand gesture recognition with flexibility in electrode arrangement and fewer electrodes. To verify the proposed method, 11 gestures, including two sets: hand gestures and pinch gestures, were selected for the experiment. Based on the functional structure of the human hand, we identified appropriate electrode positions and placed five electrodes on the hand surface for bio-impedance signal measurement. Compared with the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) method, which uses a band with the same number of electrodes wrapped around the wrist, the proposed method achieved 98.7% recognition accuracies on the hand gesture set and 97.8% on the pinch gesture set, while the EIT achieved only 97.1% and 86.3%, respectively. In particular, the proposed method demonstrated the advantage of distinguishing gestures with similar muscle contractions.

**Keywords**: Control systems; Impedance; Manipulators; Medical application; multi-robot control; Multi-robot systems; Robot kinematics; Robots; Scalability; tele-impedance.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, we present an online scalable tele-impedance framework, which enables the individual and collaborative control of multiple different robotic platforms. The framework provides an intuitive low-cost interface with visual feedback and a SpaceMouse, through which the operator can define the desired task-level trajectories and impedance profiles. With a simple mouse click, the user can switch between the robots and the collaborative operation mode. The control, subsequently, manages the distribution of the required parameters into the involved robots. Thanks to the introduced virtual hand concept, where each robot is defined as a finger, new robots can be easily added or removed via their kinodynamic parameters. The proposed framework was evaluated with three different experiments: a simulated auscultation on a mock-up patient, a cooperative task where a robot drives the patient on a wheelchair and a different robot performs the auscultation, and a collaborative task where two robots relocate a container. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the framework in terms of adaptability to different robotic platforms, the number of robots involved, and the task requirements. Additionally, quantitative and subjective analysis of 12 subjects showed how the developed interface, even in the presence of inaccurate visual feedback, allowed a smooth and accurate execution of the tasks.

**Keywords**: Controllers; Robust control; Feedback control; Muscle; Stiffness; Delay control systems; Functional electric stimulation.<br>
**Abstract**: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is often used, typically in an open-loop manner, to restore paralyzed motor function for daily living activities. Several feedback control strategies have been developed to improve the performance and usability of FES-evoked movement. However, most of them have been position controllers, while the control strategy for human movement has been known as impedance modulation. Moreover, few studies have attempted to use antagonistic co-contraction for FES feedback control despite its expected benefits, such as enhanced stability and performance and better rehabilitation outcome. In this paper, we propose a robust impedance controller for FES that can adjust the intrinsic joint stiffness using co-contraction. It consists of an impedance control law based on time-delay estimation to compensate for the nonlinear uncertain joint dynamics and an antagonistic muscle co-contraction allocator to address the intrinsic joint stiffness caused by the co-contraction. The proposed controller was implemented on the ankle joints of five healthy subjects to simulate a standing balance situation. The results verified that the proposed controller can achieve desired impedance accurately by adjusting the intrinsic stiffness that stems from the change in the amount of co-contraction (up to 48.4% better impedance achievement with high desired stiffness).  2001-2011 IEEE.

- (2021) Analysis of Coupling Effect in Human-Commanded Stiffness During Bilateral Tele-Impedance, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2020.3047064.<br>
**Keywords**: Coupling effect; Couplings; Force; force feedback; Force feedback; Impedance; impedance control; Muscles; Robots; stiffness command interface; Task analysis; tele-impedance.<br>
**Abstract**: Tele-impedance augments classic teleoperation by enabling the human operator to actively command remote robot stiffness in real-time, which is an essential ability to successfully interact with the unstructured and unpredictable environment. However, the literature is missing a study on benefits and drawbacks of different types of stiffness command interfaces used in bilateral tele-impedance. In this article, we introduce a term called coupling effect, which pertains to the coupling between human-commanded stiffness going to the remote robot and force feedback coming from the remote robot. We hypothesize that, whenever the operator's commanded stiffness and force feedback are subject to coupling effect (e.g., muscle activity based stiffness command interfaces), force feedback can invoke involuntary changes in the commanded stiffness due to human reflexes. Although the coupling effect takes away some degree of the operator's control over the commanded stiffness, these involuntary changes can be either beneficial (e.g., during position tracking) or detrimental (e.g., during force tracking) to the task performance on the remote robot side. We examined the coupling effect in an experimental study with 16 participants, who performed position and force tracking tasks by using both coupled type (muscle activity based) and decoupled type (external device based) of interface. The results demonstrate a benefit of the coupling effect when the remote robot is operating in presence of unexpected force perturbations, where lower absolute error in position tracking task was observed. On the other hand, the decoupled type of interface is beneficial for force tracking tasks on the remote robot side, such as establishing or maintaining a stable contact with objects. However, the coupling effect negatively influences the commanding of reference stiffness to the remote robot in both position and force tracking tasks for the coupled type of interface, compared to the decoupled type of interface, which is not affected.

**Keywords**: Coordinated robots; Impedance; impedance control; neural networks; Neural networks; Observers; Output feedback; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; state observer; uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: The impedance control for coordinated robots interacting with the unknown environment is investigated in this article, subject to unknown system dynamics and the environment with which coordinated robots come into contact. For the whole system, impedance control is developed for coordinated robots. The notable feature is that the robot-environment interaction performance is improved without any information about the environment, so that the robotic system follows the commanded position trajectory in noncontact phase, while the desired destination is obtained according to the force exerted on the environment during contact phase. Moreover, based on assumption that some system signals are unmeasurable, output feedback control is designed for coordinated robot systems, where a state observer based on neural network technique is designed, that can force the state estimate error converge to a small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

**Keywords**: Approximate dynamic inversion (ADI); Control theory; Convergence; Dynamics; Force; Impedance; impedance control; robot control; Robots; Stability analysis; trajectory tracking; variable impedance.<br>
**Abstract**: Variable impedance control has been considered as one of the most important compliant control approaches for its abilities in improving compliance, safety, and efficiency in robot-environment interaction. However, existing variable impedance controllers have deficits in stability guarantee. This article proposes a stability-guaranteed variable impedance control approach for robots with modeling uncertainties based on approximate dynamic inversion (ADI). Novel constraints on variable impedance profiles are given to guarantee the exponential stability of the desired variable impedance dynamics. An ADI-based impedance control law is designed to achieve the desired variable impedance dynamics through the convergence of a variable impedance error. Based on the extended Tikhonovs theorem, it is proven that the closed-loop control system has semiglobal practical exponential stability. The proposed impedance controller can be implemented in a PID form and is appealing for its simple structure, easy implementation, and control stability guarantee. The effectiveness of the proposed variable impedance controller is illustrated by an illustrative example taken on a five-bar parallel robot.

**Keywords**: Acceleration; Damping; Impedance; impedance control; intent recognition; Physical human-robot interaction; Robots; Stability criteria; Task analysis; Torque; wearable robots.<br>
**Abstract**: This letter introduces a variable impedance controller which dynamically modulates both its damping and stiffness to improve the trade-off between stability and agility in coupled human-robot systems and reduce the human user's effort. The controller applies a range of robotic damping from negative to positive values to either inject or dissipate energy based on the user's intent of motion. The controller also estimates the user's intent of direction and applies a variable stiffness torque to stabilize the user towards an estimated ideal trajectory. To evaluate the controller's ability to improve the stability/agility trade-off and reduce human effort, a study was designed for human subjects to perform a 2D target reaching task while coupled with a wearable ankle robot. A constant impedance condition was selected as a control with which to compare the variable impedance condition. The position, speed, and muscle activation responses were used to quantify the user's stability, agility, and effort, respectively. Stability was quantified spatially and temporally, with both overshoot and stabilization time showing no statistically significant difference between the two experimental conditions. Agility was quantified using mean and maximum speed, with both increasing from the constant impedance to variable impedance condition by 29.8% and 59.9%, respectively. Effort was quantified by the overall and maximum muscle activation data, both of which showed a ~10% reduction in effort. Overall, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the variable impedance controller.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive control; Admittance control; Dynamics; Force; human–robot–environment interaction (HREI); iterative least squares (ILS) method; momentum observer; neural adaptive control; Observers; Robot sensing systems.<br>
**Abstract**: To go from human demonstration to robot independent operation, there are generally three phases of interaction to undergo, including human-robot interaction (HRI), human-robot-environment interaction (HREI), and robot-environment interaction (REI). Most existing methods address problems of a single stage. In this article, a unified neural adaptive control method that organically fuses multiple interactions is proposed. HRI, REI, and their coupling effects in HREI are comprehensively considered. First, the iterative least squares method is used for robot dynamics identification based on the linearized momentum observer. The accuracy of external force observation is improved to deal with dynamic uncertainties. The human force and the environmental force are achieved and decoupled by using only a force sensor, a momentum observer, and a selection matrix S. Next, the neural adaptive control method compensating position errors caused by the model uncertainty is addressed. The control system is proved to be stable based on the Lyapunov theorem. The trajectory tracking error under the model uncertainties is reduced. Then, the adaptive admittance control method is introduced. The interaction force of HRI is minimized and the interaction force control of REI is realized. Finally, the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.

**Keywords**: Admittance; functional electrical stimulation (FES); Lyapunov; Lyapunov methods; Neuromuscular stimulation; nonlinear control; Nonlinear control systems; rehabilitation; Rehabilitation robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: Motorized functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling is a promising rehabilitation strategy for individuals with movement disorders, particularly when the pedals of the FES cycle are decoupled to measure and address asymmetries. In this article, a rehabilitation robot, i.e., a split-crank FES cycle, is developed which utilizes a combined admittance-cadence controller to address rider asymmetries through adaptation, ensure rider safety, and electrically stimulate the rider's leg muscles to pedal the cycle at the desired cadence. The theoretical development of the controllers is based on a combined Lyapunov-passivity switched systems stability analysis. Experiments were conducted on one able-bodied participant and three participants with various movement disorders, resulting in an average admittance tracking error of -0.13 ± 1.77 RPM with adaptation and -0.03 ± 4.05 RPM without adaptation. The split-crank FES cycle successfully admits to the rider, preserves rider safety, and offers a promising robotic rehabilitation strategy for individuals affected by movement disorders.

**Keywords**: Actuators; Compliance and impedance control; compliant joints and mechanisms; Damping; Impedance; Mathematical model; Robots; Shock absorbers; Springs.<br>
**Abstract**: In situations of harsh impacts, damping injection directly on the link of an articulated soft robot is challenging and usually requires high actuator torques at the moment of impact. In this work, we discuss the underlying reasons and analyze the performance limitations arising in the implementation of basic impedance elements, such as springs and dampers, through the elastic structure preserving impedance (ESPi) control framework. Using the insights obtained, we present a way to design impedance controllers with a damping design based on dynamic extensions. Inspired by the design of shock absorbers and the muscle-tendon model, the presented damping layout requires substantially smaller actuator torques in situations where the robot is subject to harsh impacts. The implementation is facilitated through the ESPi control framework resulting in a physically intuitive impedance design. The resulting closed-loop system can be interpreted as an interconnection of passive Euler Lagrange systems, which again, yields a passive system. The design's passive nature ensures stability in the free motion case and enables the robot to interact robustly and safely with its environment. The work focuses on robotic systems with no inertial coupling between the motor and link dynamics. Experimental results, obtained with the presented design on a dedicated series elastic actuator (SEA) test bed, are reported and discussed.

**Keywords**: Collaboration; Electrical impedance tomography (EIT); Electrodes; grasp force estimation; human–machine interface; human–robot collaboration; Muscles; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Sensors; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Adaptation to the operator's intents and the external physical uncertainties is critical to the performances of the human–robot collaboration. In this study, we proposed a control interface that combined the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) based sensing approach with the robotic controllers to produce proper assistance with external uncertainties in the collaborative task. The interface first estimates the continuous forearm muscle contractions (represented by the grasp forces) by the optimized EIT features with an easily worn fabric band. The recognition decisions then serve as the control inputs to adjust the state transitions and the desired interaction forces in real time. We evaluated the interface in the tasks of grasp force estimation and human–robot sawing by recruiting more than 20 subjects in total. For grasp force estimation, the interface produced an average of $R^{2}\geq 0.9$ in both offline and online validations with the feature optimization procedure and a sigmoid regression function. The interface was robust to external disturbances without retraining or manual calibrations. The average $R^{2}=0.86$ with the untrained dynamic postures, and the average $R^{2}$ values ranged from 0.85 to 0.88 in the tests with redonning the front-end in interday and intraday uses. For human–robot sawing, the interface accomplished the tasks with a high success rate in controlling the states ($>$96%) and intuitive adjusting of the sawing forces, being combined with the designed hybrid admittance/position controller. It was also adaptive to the sawing frequency changes and the sawing directions according to the operator's intents. The interface's performances are comparable, if not better, to the state of the art on both biological signal based grasp force estimation and human–robot sawing. Future efforts are worth being paid in this new direction to get more promising outcomes.

**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance control; Aerospace electronics; dynamic motion primitives (DMPs); exoskeleton robot; Exoskeletons; Gaussian mixture model (GMM); human–robot cooperative manipulation; integral barrier Lyapunov function (IBLF); Robot motion; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a skill learning-based hierarchical control strategy for human-robot cooperative manipulation, which constitutes a novel learning-control system. The high-level learning strategy aims to learn the motor skills from human demonstrations by fusion with dynamic motion primitives (DMPs) and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The lower level control strategy guarantees the compliance of the robot movement under human interaction using admittance control and integral barrier Lyapunov function (IBLF)-based adaptive neural controller. First, the robot learns the motor skills from observing the successful execution of tasks by a demonstrator through DMP-GMM methods. Then, the robot reproduces the complex skills and executes the interactive task by demonstrations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed learning-control strategy is demonstrated with experimental results. The results show that the developed hierarchical strategy has good performance in cooperation by learning and control that reacts compliantly to robot interaction with human subjects.

**Keywords**: Acoustics; Admittance; Delamination; electromechanical admittance (EMA); Finite element analysis; finite-element (FE) method; Impedance; Integrated circuit modeling; piezoelectric transducer; structural health monitoring (SHM); Transducers.<br>
**Abstract**: The transducer is an essential part of all ultrasonic systems used for applications such as medical diagnostics, therapy, nondestructive evaluation, and cleaning because its health condition is vital to their proper operation. Defects within the active element, backing or other constitutive elements, and loss of adhesion between layers can significantly weaken the performance of a transducer. The objective of this work is to determine procedures to monitor the behavior of a single-element probe during its lifetime and detect degradations before they significantly affect the performance of the system. To achieve this, electromechanical admittance (EMA)-based method is envisaged numerically and experimentally. A simplified single-element transducer consisting of a piezoceramic disk, a bonding layer, and a backing is studied and the influence of bonding delamination on EMA is investigated. This study considers three different types of delaminations, which are named, respectively, “center” (circular delamination from the center of the disk toward the peripheric zone), “peripheric” (annular delamination from the peripheric zone toward the center), and “wedge” (wedge-shaped delamination with a given angle). For each case, a numerical model based on the finite-element (FE) method is developed: a 2-D FE analysis is implemented for the first two types of delaminations, taking advantage of their axisymmetric structure, and “wedge” delamination is modeled in 3-D. Then, transducers with different shapes of 3-D printed backings are mounted and experiments are conducted using an impedance analyzer. Finally, experimental results are found to be in good agreement with numerical solutions and it shows that changes in EMA can particularly reveal the occurrence and extent of delamination in an ultrasound probe.

- (2021) Unified Motion/Force/Impedance Control for Manipulators in Unknown Contact Environments Based on Robust Model-Reaching Approach, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2021.3081594.<br>
**Keywords**: Dynamics; Force; Force control; Impedance; impedance control; manipulator control; Manipulator dynamics; Target tracking; Tracking; Trajectory; trajectory adaptation; unknown environment.<br>
**Abstract**: With the developments of intelligent and autonomous robotic technology, robots are usually designed to confront sophisticated tasks such as automated assembly, which requires both high-speed positioning capabilities and compliance with unknown contact environments. As we know, a high-performance motion tracking control in free space can achieve efficient and accurate positioning, while impedance or force control shows superior performance in terms of sensitive force and compliance with unknown contact environments. However, it is still challenging to achieve both high-performance motion tracking and compliance within one single control framework, especially in unknown contact environments. To this end, in this article, a unified motion/force/impedance approach for unknown contact environments is proposed by robust model-reaching control with dynamic trajectory adaptation. Specifically, the overall control scheme includes two loops: the outer loop replans the trajectories of motion and force in real time to meet the environmental constraints, which are estimated by the recursive least squares estimation law; in the inner loop, the robust model-reaching control law is proposed to realize a target model, which is designed to establish a dynamic relationship between the motion and force tracking errors of the replanned trajectories. Then, by changing the matrices of the target model, the compromise between motion tracking and force tracking can be achieved, as well as different control objectives. Experiments are conducted on a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator to validate the advantages of the proposed scheme.

- (2021) Maxwell-Model-Based Compliance Control for Human–Robot Friendly Interaction, **in** *IEEE Trans. Cogn. Dev. Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCDS.2020.2992538.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance control; compliance control; Force; Human-robot interaction; Impedance; Mathematical model; Maxwell model; null space; plastic deformation; Robots; Shock absorbers; Springs.<br>
**Abstract**: This article explores an alternative design philosophy of compliance control for safe and friendly human-robot interaction. Conventional approaches are based on the Voigt model with spring and damper connected in parallel. The theoretical and experimental results of disciplines other than robotics (e.g., mechanics of materials and elastoplastic mechanics) show that the Maxwell model has the merit of removing the elastic return force and reducing the effect of collisions with respect to the Voigt model. Therefore, the authors are motivated to exploit the advantages of the Maxwell model in reactions to human interactions and develop a series of Maxwell model-based compliance control methodologies, which only require kinematic control interfaces. First, a Maxwell model-based Cartesian admittance control scheme is presented to produce a novel plastic compliance of robot end effector. Moreover, we present a Maxwell model-based null space admittance control approach for manipulators with redundancy to achieve a novel plastic whole body compliance. We have evaluated the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed methods by extensive comparative experiments on human-robot cooperative tasks in various sectors, including domestic, part assembly, and robotic puncture surgery. Our approaches can be viewed as a new and comfortable interface of physical human-robot interaction and collaboration.

- (2021) A Framework for Autonomous Impedance Regulation of Robots Based on Imitation Learning and Optimal Control, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2020.3033260.<br>
**Keywords**: Ellipsoids; Imitation learning; Impedance; Optimal control; optimization and optimal control; physical human-robot interaction; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: In this work, we propose a framework to address the autonomous impedance regulation problem of robots in a class of constrained manipulation tasks. In this framework, a human arm endpoint stiffness model is used to extract the task stiffness geometry along the constrained trajectory, which is then encoded offline and reproduced online by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), respectively. Furthermore, the full Cartesian impedance of the robot is formulated through an optimal control problem, i.e., the Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR), in which the task stiffness geometry (extracted from human demonstrations) is considered as the time-varying weighting matrix Q. The optimal impedance is eventually realised by the robot through a task geometry consistent Cartesian impedance controller. A tank-based passivity observer is implemented to give evidence on the stability of the system during online impedance variations. To evaluate the performance of the framework, a comparative experiment with three different impedance settings (i.e., the proposed framework, the framework without LQR and the framework without GMM/GMR) for Franka Emika Panda to perform a door opening task was conducted. The results reveal that our framework outperforms the other two, in terms of tracking error and the interaction forces.

**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance control; Artificial neural networks; error transformation; Force; force observer; Kinect; neural adaptive control; neural networks (NNs); robot; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, a force sensorless control scheme based on neural networks (NNs) is developed for interaction between robot manipulators and human arms in physical collision. In this scheme, the trajectory is generated by using geometry vector method with Kinect sensor. To comply with the external torque from the environment, this paper presents a sensorless admittance control approach in joint space based on an observer approach, which is used to estimate external torques applied by the operator. To deal with the tracking problem of the uncertain manipulator, an adaptive controller combined with the radial basis function NN (RBFNN) is designed. The RBFNN is used to compensate for uncertainties in the system. In order to achieve the prescribed tracking precision, an error transformation algorithm is integrated into the controller. The Lyapunov functions are used to analyze the stability of the control system. The experiments on the Baxter robot are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed control scheme.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive control; Admittance; admittance control; Artificial neural networks; broad learning; Dynamics; Force; force/torque observer; neural networks (NNs); Robot sensing systems.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a neural network based admittance control scheme for robotic manipulators when interacting with the unknown environment in the presence of the actuator deadzone without needing force sensing. A compliant behavior of robotic manipulators in response to external torques from the unknown environment is achieved by admittance control. Inspired by broad learning system, a flatted neural network structure using radial basis function (RBF) with incremental learning algorithm is proposed to estimate the external torque, which can avoid retraining process if the system is modeled insufficiently. To deal with uncertainties in the robot system, an adaptive neural controller with dynamic learning framework is developed to ensure the tracking performance. Experiments on the Baxter robot have been implemented to test the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: active power adjustment; Frequency control; Frequency modulation; frequency response speed; Impedance; inertia; Power system dynamics; Power system stability; Synchronous generators; Time-frequency analysis; virtual impedance; Virtual synchronous generator.<br>
**Abstract**: The application of virtual synchronous generators in the power system eases the pressure on the grid caused by penetration of lots of power electronic devices, but worsens the dynamic frequency stability of the grid. Meanwhile, in order to solve the problem of power coupling in low-voltage micro-grid systems, most measures introduced virtual impedance technology to adjust the equivalent output impedance of the system. Therefore, most studies have adopted the adaptive control strategy of the moment of inertia, to improve the dynamic frequency adjustment of the grid. However, it will cause the frequency response speed reduction problem. In order to deal with the contradiction between the moment of inertia and frequency response speed, the voltage phasor relationship of the micro-source - grid system under signal disturbance in the introduction of virtual impedance is analyzed. Then an adaptive virtual impedance control strategy is proposed to accelerate the active power adjustment process of the virtual synchronous generator system, which helps to complete the first frequency modulation and improve the inertia adjustment ability. Finally, combining these two control strategies, a coordinated adaptive moment of inertia and virtual impedance control strategy is proposed. From the perspective of the moment of inertia and virtual impedance, the proposed method fully exploits the control advantages of the virtual synchronous generator system and achieves the purpose of adjusting the inertia of the virtual synchronous generator system while considering the acceleration of the frequency response speed. The comprehensive simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance control; Electromyography; Exoskeletons; Human-robot cooperation control; Muscles; Robot-assisted rehabilitation; Robots; Stability analysis; Stroke; Surface electromyography (sEMG); Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: Control schemes based on electromyography (EMG) have demonstrated their superiority in human-robot cooperation due to the fact that motion intention can be well estimated by EMG signals. However, there are several limitations due to the noisy nature of EMG signals and the inaccuracy of EMG-force/torque estimation, which might deteriorate the stability of human-robot cooperation movement. To improve the movement stability, an EMG-based admittance control scheme (EACS) was proposed, comprised of an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model (EDMM), an admittance filter and an inner position controller. To investigate the performance of EACS, a series of sinusoidal tracking tasks were conducted with 12 healthy participants and 4 stroke survivors in an ankle exoskeleton in comparison with the EMG-based open-loop control scheme (EOCS). The experimental results indicated that both EACS and EOCS could improve stroke survivors' ankle range of motion (ROM). The experimental results of both healthy participants and stroke survivors showed that the assistance torque, tracking error and jerk values of EACS were lower than those of EOCS. The interaction torque of EACS decreased towards the increasing assistance ratio while that of EOCS increased. Moreover, the EMG levels of tibialis anterior (TA) decreased towards the increasing assistance ratio but were higher than those of EOCS. EACS was effective in improving movements stability, and had the potential to be applied in robot-assisted rehabilitation training to address the foot-drop problem.

- (2021) Biologically-Inspired Impedance Control With Hysteretic Damping, **in** *IEEE Control Syst. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3044101.<br>
**Keywords**: Biologically-inspired methods; Damping; Frequency control; hysteretic damping; Impedance; PD control; Robots; switched systems; Switches; Time-domain analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Recent experiments have shown that human joints can maintain a constant damping ratio across a wide range of external loads. This behavior can be explained by the use of a “complex stiffness” frequency-domain model approximating the impedance of the human joint. However, for a robot to replicate this naturally beneficial human behavior would require a time-domain model of this nonlinear joint impedance. This letter demonstrates that there exists a nonlinear time-domain model (originally from the structural mechanics community) that has a frequency-domain “describing function” that matches the complex stiffness model observed in humans. We provide an extension of this nonlinear time-domain model that removes the need to implement hard-switching control input. In addition, we demonstrate that this proportional-and-hysteretic-damping controller has inertia-invariant overshoot and therefore offers an advantage over the more common proportional-derivative control approach. Implementing the proposed proportional-and-hysteretic-damping control in a single-joint test-robot, we demonstrate for the first time that the desired frequency domain behavior can be reproduced in practice.

- (2021) Sensor Reduction, Estimation, and Control of an Upper-Limb Exoskeleton, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3056366.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Compliance and impedance control; Estimation; Exoskeletons; Kalman filters; Mathematical model; physical human-robot interaction; prosthetics and exoskeletons; rehabilitation robotics; Robot sensing systems; Sensor fusion; wearable robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: A multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) exoskeleton relies on an array of sensors to communicate its state (e.g., positions/orientations) and operator-exoskeleton contact interactions (e.g., forces/torques) to its control system. Although sensor redundancy is common in biological systems to cope with uncertainty and partial failure of sensors, in man-made systems, sensor redundancy increases the overall system's cost and control complexity. This study presents a sensor reduction technique for force/torque (F/T) sensors utilizing a Kalman filter-based sensor fusion system in the context of admittance control. The methodology is applied to the EXO-UL8 exoskeleton, which is a powered, redundant, dual-arm, upper-limb robotic system with (7 arm + 1 hand) DOFs incorporating three 6-axis F/T sensors in each arm. Motivated by improving wearability through minimizing human-exoskeleton contact interfaces, which reduces spurious contact forces due to joint misalignment; and reducing cost, the proposed strategy emulates the admittance controller's virtual dynamics with only a subset of sensors, resulting in the physical human-robot interaction feeling the same from the operator's perspective. Experimental results indicate that human-exoskeleton power exchange and actuation stresses of the operator's joints, with the proposed strategy on a subset of two sensors, are comparable to those in the full three-sensor case (p <; 0.01). The experiments verify the proposed methodology for the EXO-UL8, and support the feasibility of operating other Kalman filter-based sensor fusion systems with fewer sensors without sacrificing transparency in physical human-robot interaction.

- (2021) A Unified Approach for Virtual Fixtures and Goal-Driven Variable Admittance Control in Manual Guidance Applications, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3093283.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Compliance and impedance control; End effectors; Force; Geometry; Haptic interfaces; human-robot collaboration; physical human-robot interaction; Shape; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: In applications of human-robot physical interaction, it is important to guarantee high accuracy not only in terms of the position of the end-effector, but also in terms of its orientation. While translational movements are easily understandable for a human, rotational ones do not have an immediate interpretation. This does not allow the operator to achieve an adequate positioning accuracy when a target orientation is set. In this work, a suitable strategy that facilitates the human in accomplishing rotational motion is proposed through the formulation of rotational virtual fixtures. This is obtained thanks to a clever description of the orientation that allows to draw an equivalence between the formulation of translational virtual fixtures and their rotational counterparts. To further improve the human comprehension of the best motion direction in the rotational world, a variable admittance control is also designed. We finally propose to jointly exploit these techniques to achieve the best possible performance in terms of positioning accuracy. The performance are evaluated by means of rotational point to point cooperative motions involving several subjects and an ABB IRB-140 robot.

**Keywords**: adaptive force amplification; Admittance; admittance control; Admittance control; Collaboration; collaborative manipulation; Fitts’ task; Force; Human factors; human intention; Human-robot interaction; Physical human-robot interaction.<br>
**Abstract**: The goal of this article is to design an admittance controller for a robot to adaptively change its contribution to a collaborative manipulation task executed with a human partner to improve the task performance. This has been achieved by adaptive scaling of human force based on her/his movement intention while paying attention to the requirements of different task phases. In our approach, movement intentions of human are estimated from measured human force and velocity of manipulated object, and converted to a quantitative value using a fuzzy logic scheme. This value is then utilized as a variable gain in an admittance controller to adaptively adjust the contribution of robot to the task without changing the admittance time constant. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach by a pHRI experiment utilizing Fitts’ reaching movement task. The results of the experiment show that there is a) an optimum admittance time constant maximizing the human force amplification and b) a desirable admittance gain profile which leads to a more effective co-manipulation in terms of overall task performance.

**Keywords**: Computational modeling; Humanoid and bipedal locomotion; Impedance; Legged locomotion; legged robots; motion control; Optimal control; optimization and optimal control; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: This letter addresses the problem of computing optimal impedance schedules for legged locomotion tasks involving complex contact interactions. We formulate the problem of impedance regulation as a trade-off between disturbance rejection and measurement uncertainty. We extend a stochastic optimal control algorithm known as Risk Sensitive Control to take into account measurement uncertainty and propose a formal way to include such uncertainty for unknown contact locations. The approach can efficiently generate optimal state and control trajectories along with local feedback control gains, i.e. impedance schedules. Extensive simulations demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in generating meaningful stiffness and damping modulation patterns before and after contact interaction. For example, contact forces are reduced during early contacts, damping increases to anticipate a high impact event and tracking is automatically traded-off for increased stability. In particular, we show a significant improvement in performance during jumping and trotting tasks with a simulated quadruped robot.

**Abstract**: The uncoupled stability of haptic rendering has been analyzed extensively, predominantly using passivity considerations. Yet, the role of the operator in improving the stability of haptic systems has received less attention. Here, towards a human-in-the-loop stability analysis of haptic rendering with delay, we study the effect of the operator impedance on the stability boundaries. We employ a method that tracks the $j\omega$ crossings of the roots of a characteristic second order equation of a coupled system that includes the impedance of the operator, the haptic device, the rendered virtual stiffness and damping, and the time delay. We found that the consideration of a realistic operator impedance leads to significantly less conservative stable time delay margins. Moreover, for certain arm impedance parameters, the coupled system may allow for: (1) assuring delay-independent stability, and (2) being stabilized by increasing the delay. These results indicate that a human-centered approach can push the boundaries of safe haptic feedback, especially in applications where the delays are substantial and unavoidable, such as in teleoperation.

- (2021) Learning Variable Impedance Control via Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Force-Related Tasks, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3061374.<br>
**Keywords**: Aerospace electronics; Compliance and impedance control; Force; Impedance; learning from demonstration; machine learning for robot control; Reinforcement learning; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: Many manipulation tasks require robots to interact with unknown environments. In such applications, the ability to adapt the impedance according to different task phases and environment constraints is crucial for safety and performance. Although many approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) and learning from demonstration (LfD) have been proposed to obtain variable impedance skills on contact-rich manipulation tasks, these skills are typically task-specific and could be sensitive to changes in task settings. This letter proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) based approach to recover both the variable impedance policy and reward function from expert demonstrations. We explore different action space of the reward functions to achieve a more general representation of expert variable impedance skills. Experiments on two variable impedance tasks (Peg-in-Hole and Cup-on-Plate) were conducted in both simulations and on a real FANUC LR Mate 200iD/7 L industrial robot. The comparison results with behavior cloning and force-based IRL proved that the learned reward function in the gain action space has better transferability than in the force space.

- (2021) Admittance Control With Unknown Location of Interaction, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3067618.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance measurement; Aerospace electronics; Compliance and impedance control; Force; force control; physical human-robot interaction; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Admittance control is commonly used for controlling robots that physically interact with the environment or objects. Its goal is to realize a desired admittance property between the interaction wrench and robot motion. The original admittance control requires the interaction wrench and motion be converted to/from the space in which the desired admittance property is defined. In this letter, we first present the end-to-end admittance control formulation that represents the direct relationship between the generalized velocity and interaction wrench measurement when they satisfy the desired admittance property. Based on this formulation, we then develop a sampling-based algorithm for directly computing the robot reference motion without using the actual location of the interaction or the additional inverse kinematics step that is typically required for task-space admittance control. The algorithm is demonstrated in a number of simulation examples including collisions with a moving object and fixed obstacle.

**Keywords**: admittance control; Admittance control; cable-driven parallel mechanism; Electromyography; EMG; Exoskeletons; hand exoskeleton; hybrid structure; reach-and-grasp; Rehabilitation robot; Rehabilitation robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: Reach-and-grasp is one of the most fundamental activities in daily life, while few rehabilitation robots provide integrated and active training of the arm and hand for patients after stroke to improve their mobility. In this study, a novel hybrid arm-hand rehabilitation robot (HAHRR) was built for the reach-and-grasp task. This hybrid structure consisted of a cable-driven module for three-dimensional arm motion and an exoskeleton for hand motion, which enabled assistance of the arm and hand simultaneously. To implement active compliance control, an EMG-based admittance controller was applied to the HAHRR. Experimental results showed that the HAHRR with the EMG-based admittance controller could not only assist the subject in fulfilling the reach-and-grasp task, but also generate smoother trajectories compared with the force-sensing-based admittance controller. These findings also suggested that the proposed approach might be applicable to post-stroke arm-hand rehabilitation training.

- (2021) A Hybrid Impedance Controller for Series Elastic Actuators to Render a Wide Range of Stable Stiffness in Uncertain Environments, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3051615.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Damping; environmental stiffness; Force; Force control; Friction; high-stiffness control; Impedance; Impedance controller; series elastic actuator; Springs; virtual damping; virtual stiffness.<br>
**Abstract**: Accurate and wide-range stiffness control is important for safe human-robot interaction. Accurate stiffness control can be better achieved using series elastic actuators (SEAs) than conventional rigid actuators. However, the stable range of virtual stiffness rendered by SEAs is limited by the stiffness of the actual spring, which cannot be too high in order to ensure good force control accuracy. Adding a virtual damper or derivative gain can increase the stable range of virtual stiffness, but the stable range would highly depend on the environmental stiffness. To relax the stiffness limitation in uncertain environments and explore more merits of SEAs, this letter proposes a hybrid impedance controller. This new controller linearly combines the spring force feedback and inertia force feedback. The stable range of virtual stiffness can be easily increased to ten times the actual spring stiffness with minimum effect on the force control accuracy. Unlike typical impedance controllers, the environmental stiffness can be used to raise the stable range of stiffness and hence the robustness of the controller can be ensured. Experiments will be provided to verify the hybrid impedance controller. We expect that the hybrid impedance controller can be used for SEAs in unstructured environments to provide a wide range of virtual stiffness.

**Keywords**: Biodynamic feedthrough (BDFT); Biological system modeling; Biomechanics; Helicopters; Marine vehicles; Muscles; Numerical models; pilot workload; pilot-assisted oscillations (PAOs); rotorcraft pilot couplings (RPCs); Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, the results of a piloted flight simulator campaign aimed at measuring biomechanical performance indicators of a helicopter pilot performing complex, realistic tasks are presented. The upper limbs' motion and the activation of the main muscle groups of the left arm were measured during ship-deck landings, performed flying several helicopter configurations with sea conditions of variable intensity. The analysis of the results shows an increase in the muscle activity relative to the increase in task difficulty, in agreement with subjective ratings (Bedford workload scale). The study provides useful indications to improve the corresponding biomechanical simulations, as well as to characterize pilot's performance during specific tasks.

**Keywords**: Admittance; Collision avoidance; Compliance and impedance control; Damping; Force; human-robot collaboration; Manuals; physical human-robot interaction; Robots; Shape.<br>
**Abstract**: In manual guidance robotic applications, like the handling of large and heavy objects in a cluttered environment, it is important to guarantee that the operator accurately reaches the goal position without collisions with working isles or other obstacles in the surrounding environment. When the transported object is bulky, the operator’s view is obstructed and the situation becomes more critical. In this work, a novel variable admittance control provides the operator with a directional haptic feedback about the best motion direction towards the goal. This feedback allows the user to accurately reach the target position in a cluttered environment, also in case his/her view is partially or totally obstructed. To select the best motion direction in a cluttered workspace, a tree-based structure rooted in the goal is optimally built offline to fully explore the environment free-space based on the workspace layout and regardless of the initial position. Then, at each time instant, the optimal motion direction is determined based on the current position with respect to the exploring structure and on the user motion intention. In this work, to build the tree structure, we adapt RRT* algorithm to the manual guidance context and we define a tailored cost function. The performance is evaluated in many scenarios with a variable number of obstacles of different shapes involving several subjects and a Comau Smart Six robot.

**Keywords**: Aerial physical interaction; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Control systems; End effectors; energy-aware robotics; energy-tanks; Impedance; impedance control; Manipulator dynamics; Observers; port-Hamiltonian systems; Regulation; Robot control.<br>
**Abstract**: This work addresses the interaction control problem of a fully actuated aerial vehicle considered as a flying end-effector. We tackle the problem using geometrically consistent variable-stiffness impedance control for safe wrench regulation using the concept of energy tanks, where both the modeling and the control are carried out in the port Hamiltonian framework. We exploit previous well-known results in the literature of ground manipulators and extend them to be applied for novel and challenging aerial physical interaction with a focus on quasi-static applications. The energy-awareness of the presented control method guarantees the stability of the aerial robot in both free-flight and in-contact scenarios together with a level of safety in the case of contact-loss with the unknown environment. Furthermore, by utilizing bond graphs we demonstrate how the closed-loop passivity can be graphically conducted. The validity of our proposed approach is shown via several experiments. We also provide several insights on how the proposed framework could be extended to a generic dynamic aerial physical interaction.

**Keywords**: End effectors; Impedance; learning from demonstration; Medical robots and systems; optimization and optimal control; physical human-robot interaction; Probes; Robot kinematics; Robots; Task analysis; task and motion planning; Ultrasonic imaging.<br>
**Abstract**: Assistive robots for healthcare have witnessed a growing demand over the past decades. In this letter, we investigate the development of an optimization-based control framework with variable impedance for an assistive robot to perform ultrasound-guided scoliosis assessment. The conventional procedure for scoliosis assessment using ultrasound imaging typically requires a medical practitioner to slide an ultrasound probe along a patient’s back while maintaining a certain magnitude of the contact force. To automate such a procedure, we need to consider multiple objectives, such as contact force, position, orientation, energy, posture, etc. To coordinate different objectives, we propose to formulate the control framework as a quadratic programming problem with each objective weighted by a tunable task priority, subject to a set of equality and inequality constraints. As the procedure requires the robot to establish a constant contact force with the patient during scanning, we incorporate variable impedance regulation of the end-effector to enhance safety and stability during the physical human-robot interaction; The variable impedance gains are then retrieved by learning from medical expert’s demonstrations. The proposed methodology is evaluated with a robotic system performing autonomous scoliosis assessment with multiple human subjects involved. The effectiveness of our approach is verified by the coronal spinal images obtained with the robot.

- (2022) Learning From Demonstration and Interactive Control of Variable-Impedance to Cut Soft Tissues, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2021.3123356.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Dynamical systems (DS); Force; Impedance; learning from demonstration (LfD); Manipulator dynamics; Robots; soft tissues; Task analysis; Trajectory; variable-impedance skill transfer.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, we propose an approach to extract variable-impedance during cutting tasks from human demonstrations, so as to ease soft-tissue cutting by robots. We model the dynamic adjustment of the human arm during interactions with the tissue and transfer these adaptive capabilities to the robot, by learning both the motion and change of impedance. To improve performance during task execution, our variable-impedance skill-transfer framework combines the learned model with an interactive-operation and feedback controller. To offer the flexibility of modifying the trajectory at run time, we use a control law based on dynamical systems. We couple this control law with virtual dynamics that describes the cutting dynamics. This ensures that the robot can control the interaction force and can plan the trajectory. The approach is validated in a real robot cutting-experiment of cutting different hardness tissues. Results show that our learning-based feedback controller, with the assistance from interactive-operation models, can effectively improve the task’s success rate, cutting length, cutting depth, and other indicators, as compared to using a fixed and variable-impedance gain controller.

**Keywords**: Biomedical monitoring; Clectrical impedance myography; Electrodes; Fatigue; Impedance; maximum voluntary contraction; Monitoring; muscle fatigue; Muscles; Neuromuscular; neuromuscular electrical stimulation; rehabilitation.<br>
**Abstract**: Objectives: During Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES), a real-time monitoring method is urgently needed to reduce the negative effect induced by muscle fatigue. Technology or Method: A novel method named electrical impedance myography (EIM) is proposed to evaluate muscle fatigue degree during NMES. The experiments were performed on the anterior tibialis muscle on several voluunteers. Two EIM parameters: impedance amplitude (|Z|) and phase (θ), were measured in real time, while applying six NMES parameter combinations. The mean power frequency (MPF) of the surface electromyography (sEMG) was selected for verification of the proposed method. Results: |Z| and θ of EIM signals decreased significantly after NMES (p < 0.05). They also both showed a linear downward trend during NMES, which was also observed in MPF of sEMG signals. At the measurement frequency of 20 kHz, steady-state fatigue was achieved when |Z| decreased to approximately 14% of the initial value. Clinical or Biological Impact: This study provides a method for monitoring muscle fatigue induced by NMES, which is beneficial to the application of NMES.

- (2022) Model Predictive Variable Impedance Control of Manipulators for Adaptive Precision-Compliance Tradeoff, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2022.3204350.<br>
**Keywords**: Aerospace electronics; Cost function; Impedance; Model predictive control; optimization; precision-compliance tradeoff; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Robots; Task analysis; variable impedance control (VIC).<br>
**Abstract**: Impedance control (IC) is widely used in contact-rich manipulator tasks since it provides manipulators with both operation precision and contact compliance, and trades them off by impedance parameters. However, fixed impedance parameters limit the applicability of IC in complex tasks during which the focus on the operation precision or the contact compliance is variable, such as physical human–robot collaboration and complex assembly tasks. This article presents model predictive variable impedance control approaches for adaptive precision-compliance tradeoff to satisfy variable task requirements. Specifically, we establish a novel impedance model, which transforms the variable impedance law design problem into a control law design problem, and allows us to consider novel impedance constraints that can determine manipulators' extreme precision and compliance properties. According to whether state constraints are further considered, one-step (OS) and multistep (MS) model predictive control approaches are proposed to solve these transformed control problems, and the corresponding optimization problem of the OS MPC can be established as a QP problem due to the special form of the novel impedance model. A tank-based approach is further proposed to correct the variable impedance laws for the system passivity concern. Various comparative experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the presented approaches.

**Keywords**: Electric potential; Electrodes; Impedance; Mathematical model; Needle electrical impedance myography (EIM); Needles; neuromuscular disorders; nonhomogeneous tissue; Radio frequency; skeletal muscle; Voltage measurement.<br>
**Abstract**: Objective: Needle electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a recently developed technique for neuromuscular evaluation. Despite its preliminary successful clinical application, further understanding is needed to aid interpreting EIM outcomes in nonhomogeneous skeletal muscle measurements. Methods: The framework presented models needle EIM measurements in a bidomain isotropic model. Finite element method (FEM) simulations verify the validity of our model predictions studying two cases: a spherical volume surrounded by tissue and a two-layered tissue. Results: Our models show that EIM is influenced by the vicinity of tissue with different electrical properties. The apparent resistance, reactance and phase relative errors between our theoretical predictions and FEM simulations in the spherical volume case study are $\leq$0.2%, $\leq$1.2% and $\leq$1.0%, respectively. For the two-layered tissue model case study, the relative errors are $\leq$2%. Conclusions: We propose a bio-physics driven analytical framework describing needle EIM measurements in a nonhomogeneous bidomain tissue model. Clinical impact: Our theoretical predictions may lead to new ways for interpreting needle EIM data in neuromuscular diseases that cause compositional changes in muscle content, e.g. connective tissue deposition within the muscle. These changes will manifest themselves by changing the electric properties of the conductor media and will impact impedance values.

- (2022) Model-Based Actor−Critic Learning of Robotic Impedance Control in Complex Interactive Environment, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIE.2021.3134082.<br>
**Keywords**: Actor−critic learning; Force; human−robot interaction; Impedance; impedance control; Indexes; robot machining; Robots; Safety; Service robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: In complex robot applications, such as human−robot interaction and robot machining, robots should interact with an unknown environment. To learn the interactive skill, a model-based actor−critic learning algorithm and a safety-learning strategy are proposed in this article to find the optimal impedance control, in which the learning process is safe and fully automatic and does not know the system parameter. In the learning algorithm, a critic is defined as a quadratic form of the system states and the external force. A modified deterministic policy gradient algorithm is presented to improve the learning efficiency. The proposed approach utilizes a model-based constraint and a highly efficient learning algorithm. In the safety-learning strategy, the robot is trained under a constant force, and the learned impedance control can transfer to different interaction situations by choosing the suitable impedance index. The effectiveness of the learning algorithm and the performance of the learned impedance control are validated in a UR5 robot. The robot can perform human−robot interaction and robot machining tasks after the training process with 100 s training time.

- (2022) Automated Off-Line Generation of Stable Variable Impedance Controllers According to Performance Specifications, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3160593.<br>
**Keywords**: compliance and impedance control; Force; Impedance; Indexes; Modulation; optimization and optimal control; Physical human-robot interaction; Robots; Stability criteria; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: In this letter, we propose a novel methodology for off-line generating stable Variable Impedance Controllers considering any parameter modulation law in function of exogenous signals to the robot, as e.g. the exerted force by the human in a collaborative task. The aim is to find the optimal controller according to a desired trade-off between accuracy and control effort. Each controller is formulated as a polytopic Linear Parameter Varying system consisting in a set of vertex systems at the limit operation points. Then, the stability and operating properties can be assessed through Linear Matrix Inequalities, from which an optimality index can be obtained. This index is used by a genetic optimisation algorithm to iteratively generate new controller solutions towards the best one. To exemplify our method we choose a case study of modulation laws for tasks that require a physical interaction between human and robot. Generated solutions for different trade-offs are evaluated on a object handover scenario using a 7-DoF WAM robotic manipulator.

- (2022) A Hybrid Learning and Optimization Framework to Achieve Physically Interactive Tasks With Mobile Manipulators, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3187258.<br>
**Keywords**: Compliance and impedance control; Force; imitation learning; Impedance; mobile mani- pulation; Robot sensing systems; Sensors; Task analysis; Torque; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: This letter proposes a hybrid learning and optimization framework for mobile manipulators for complex and physically interactive tasks. The framework exploits an admittance-type physical interface to obtain intuitive and simplified human demonstrations and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)/Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) to encode and generate the learned task requirements in terms of position, velocity, and force profiles. Next, using the desired trajectories and force profiles generated by GMM/GMR, the impedance parameters of a Cartesian impedance controller are optimized online through a Quadratic Program augmented with an energy tank to ensure the passivity of the controlled system. Two experiments are conducted to validate the framework, comparing our method with two approaches with constant stiffness (high and low). The results showed that the proposed method outperforms the other two cases in terms of trajectory tracking and generated interaction forces, even in the presence of disturbances such as unexpected end-effector collisions.

- (2022) Spatial Repetitive Impedance Learning Control for Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2022.3221931.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptive control; Impedance; impedance learning; iterative learning control; Iterative methods; Legged locomotion; Regulation; rehabilitation robot; repetitive learning control; robot control; Robots; spatial periodicity; Task analysis; Time-domain analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: In robot-assisted rehabilitation and leg exoskeletons, humans and robots are required to collaboratively complete repetitive tasks with fixed periodic paths. In such applications, impedance learning control can provide variable impedance regulation for improving the performance of physical interactions; however, designing such control is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in modeling human time-varying dynamics. By exploiting the spatial periodicity characteristics of the desired trajectory and human impedance, we propose a novel spatial repetitive impedance learning control strategy to enhance interaction performance. First, a defined spatial operator serves as the mathematics foundation for constructing the robot dynamics in the spatial domain. Then, a spatial impedance learning controller is designed. In this article, time-varying impedance profiles are estimated using spatial full-saturation iterative learning laws, while robotic parameter uncertainties are estimated using the differential adaptation law with projection modification. We validate the uniform convergence of the tracking error through a Lyapunov-like analysis and demonstrate the control effectiveness using an illustrative example. Compared with related results on temporal repetitive learning control, the proposed control approach can enable human–robot system to complete a repetitive task with unspecified speeds according to the users' strengths and motion capacity.

- (2022) A Unified Parametric Representation for Robotic Compliant Skills With Adaptation of Impedance and Force, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2021.3109160.<br>
**Keywords**: Biomimetic control; compliant manipulation; Force; human–robot physical interaction; Impedance; impedance and force learning; learning from human demonstrations (LfHD); Mechatronics; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: Robotic compliant manipulation is a very challenging but urgent research spot in the domain of robotics. One difficulty lies in the lack of a unified representation for encoding and learning of compliant profiles. This article aims to introduce a novel learning and control framework to address this problem: 1) we provide a parametric representation that enables a compliant skill to be encoded in a parametric space and allows a robot to learn compliant manipulation skills based on motion and force information collected from human demonstrations; and 2) the updating laws of the compliant profiles, including impedance and force profiles, are derived from a biomimetic control strategy based on the human motor learning principles. Our approach enables the simultaneous adaptation of impedance and feedforward force online during robot’s reproduction of the demonstrated tasks to deal with task dynamics and external interferences. The proposed approach is verified based on both simulation and real-world task scenarios.

- (2022) Reinforcement Learning Impedance Control of a Robotic Prosthesis to Coordinate With Human Intact Knee Motion, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3179420.<br>
**Keywords**: compliance and impedance control; Impedance; Knee; Legged locomotion; physical human-robot interaction; Prosthetics; prosthetics and exoskeletons; Reinforcement learning; Robot kinematics; Robots; Tuning.<br>
**Abstract**: This study aims to demonstrate reinforcement learning tracking control for automatically configuring the impedance parameters of a robotic knee prosthesis. While our previous studies involving human subjects have focused on tuning the impedance control parameters to meet a fixed, subjectively prescribed target motion profile to enable continuous walking with human-in-the-loop, in this paper we develop a new tracking control solution for a robotic knee to mimic the motion of the intact knee. As such, we replaced the prescribed target knee motion by an automatically generated profile based on the intact knee. As the profile of the intact knee varies over time due to human adaptation, we are presented with a challenging tracking control problem in the context of classical control theory. By formulating the “echo control” of the robotic knee as a reinforcement learning problem, we provide a promising new tool for real-time tracking control design without explicitly representing the underlying dynamics using a mathematical model, which can be difficult to obtain for a human-robot system. Additionally, our results may inspire future studies and new robotic prosthesis impedance control designs that can potentially coordinate between the intact and the robotic limbs toward daily use of the robotic device.

- (2022) EMG-Based Variable Impedance Control With Passivity Guarantees for Collaborative Robotics, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3149575.<br>
**Keywords**: Collaboration; Compliance and Impedance Control; Electromyography; Force measurement; Human-Robot Collaboration; Impedance; Physical Human-Robot Interaction; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, a new methodology is developed for safely changing the interaction dynamics of a collaborative robot. A strategy based on electromyography is proposed to distinguish operator forces from those resulting from interactions with the environment. This allows to obtain information about the operator intentions and include it into the robot control strategy for an enhanced physical human–robot interaction. The safety of the resulting variable impedance control is guaranteed by imposing the passivity of the interaction. Experimental validation shows a good performance of the proposed method and illustrates the advantages of such a strategy in cases where human, robot and environment interact with each other.

**Keywords**: Admittance; Force and tactile sensing; Grasping; Legged locomotion; physical human-robot interaction; physically assistive devices; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Skin.<br>
**Abstract**: An intelligent assistive robotic walker can be a tremendous help to patients with mobility disorders, e.g., hemiplegia patients. However, at the same time, a full-size assistive walker could be difficult to steer due to the reduced balancing ability of the patient. An intuitive interface can provide a promising solution to the low operability of such robotized assistive devices. Commonly developed gait assistance methodologies perform real-time adjustment of admittance model parameters in a forward direction. However, such a variable admittance model often accidentally affects the rotation behavior as well, which can lead to reducing the operability of the robotic device. To resolve such operational issues, we propose an in-Hand Admittance Controller (i-HAC) as a novel physical human-robot interaction interface for a robotic assistive walker. i-HAC is composed of multiple admittance models based on grasping feedback from sensitive robotic skin placed on both handlebars of a robotic assistive walker. This controller is formulated as a multiple-point-mass-damper system and can generate intuitive movement in both single and dual grasping situations. We conduct two experiments to demonstrate the benefits of i-HAC on a full-sized robotic walker in going forward with single grasping and rotating with dual grasping in comparison to the conventional admittance controller. Our experimental studies show that i-HAC potentially reduces the operation effort by 85% in the single grasping case and improves rotation consistency by 93% in the dual grasping case.

**Keywords**: Fabrication; fiber threading; Force; Impedance; impedance control with force tracking; Mechanical factors; Message systems; Optical fiber sensors; Robotic and automation; Robots.<br>
**Abstract**: Gel-like matter is used extensively in a wide range of application fields including industrial applications such as the manufactory and assembly of garment and footwear products, soft macro/micro-robotics, medical diagnostics, and drug delivery. However, the manipulation of gel-like matter is very challenging, due to its high deformability, high viscosity, and fast phase changing. In this letter, we propose a novel biomimetic robotic fiber threading approach based on impedance control with force tracking. The highly integrated approach can control the impedance of the fiber during both threading and solidification of the fiber and characterize the mechanical properties of the fabricated fibers in the very same setup without changing parts. The impedance control method has also been adapted in this letter by adding a real-time estimator for continuously estimating the stiffness of the threading force for highly accurate control. The resulted fibers using the proposed approach demonstrates higher performances in all terms of toughness, stiffness, elongation and strength, compared to the traditional velocity controlled fiber fabrication approach.

**Keywords**: Estimation; Force; Fractional-order system; neural network based estimation; Numerical stability; sliding mode control (SMC); Stability criteria; telerobotic system; Telerobotics; Trajectory; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes a variable structure control with neural network and optimized fractional-order selection policy for the sensorless telerobotic system with uncertain time delay, model uncertainty, fractional calculus numerical approximation bias, and external disturbance. Expanded from the integer-order calculus based on the definition of Caputo and the comparison principle, the Riemann–Liouville-based uniformly ultimately bounded stability is introduced to synthesize the sliding mode control with varying order, and the corresponding neural network based force estimation, which is optimized by the specified order based on the greed algorithm. Combined with the mixed-type error, the proposed hybrid integer-order and fractional-order analysis methodology is capable of guaranteeing the Riemann–Liouville-based uniformly ultimately bounded stability of tracking and synchronization errors under time delay. According to Euler difference, the proposed synthesis method can suppress the combined error in the boundedness of approximating double Euler difference errors. Numerical simulation and experiment of the telerobotic system under the control of the proposed method verify the stability analyses.

**Keywords**: Bioinspired robot learning; dynamic movement primitives (DMPs); Electromyography; human factors and human-in-the-loop; Impedance; learning from demonstration (LfD); Muscles; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory; variable impedance skill transfer.<br>
**Abstract**: Endowing robots with human-like abilities to perform motor skills smoothly and naturally is one of the important goals of robotics. Learning from demonstration (LfD) has been successfully applied for learning tasks on robots, for which the human tutor can demonstrate a successful execution. Learning human stiffness schedule strategy is one of the promising approaches for lightweight collaborative robots to execute physical in-contact tasks while remaining compliant when possible, as it enables robots to show human-like adaptive impedance behavior in an effective and efficient manner. In this letter, we develop a robot skill learning framework considering both movement and impedance features. Electromyography (EMG)-based method is used to estimate human upper limb stiffness such that the information of impedance can be obtained. Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) model is employed to model movement and impedance features simultaneously. Throughout this procedure, the robot skills learning from a human tutor can be achieved. Besides, the learned skills can be generalized. An impedance controller imitating the human impedance mechanism is utilized in the task reproduction phase to achieve both task successful execution and safe physical interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified in a water pumping task on a Kinova robot.

**Keywords**: admittance control; contact force estimation; Dynamics; End effectors; Extended sliding mode observer; Force; hydraulic robots; Hydraulic systems; Impedance; Robots; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: In this letter, an admittance control algorithm has been proposed for hydraulic robots in the presence of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and system nonlinearities without contact force sensors. An extended sliding mode observer (ESMO) is firstly developed based on joint force sensors and pressure signals in chambers of hydraulic actuators to estimate not only the contact force with an environment but also the joint velocities which are robust to unknown friction in hydraulic actuators. Matched uncertainties and disturbances in actuator dynamics are observed by a matched disturbance observer. These techniques are integrated into the backstepping framework to handle high nonlinearities in the hydraulic and mechanical systems and achieve the desired admittance behavior of the robotics system. Simulation results are conducted with a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) hydraulic leg robot with different case studies, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive cooperative control (ACC) strategy; electromyography (EMG); Estimation; Exoskeletons; Impedance; joint impedance; Muscles; musculoskeletal model; Solid modeling; Wrist; wrist rehabilitation robot.<br>
**Abstract**: Wrist rehabilitation exoskeletons have gained much attention over the last decades, striving to restore motor functions for patients with neuromuscular disorders. Electromyography signal has been employed to estimate the motion intention to achieve interactive training schemes. However, it is a challenging task to estimate the joint impedance in real time, as it is a crucial parameter for control of exoskeletons. This article proposes an adaptive cooperative control strategy for a wrist exoskeleton based on a real-time joint impedance estimation approach. By explicitly interpreting the underlying transformation in the muscular and skeletal systems, the proposed approach estimates the motion intention and the joint impedance of a human subject simultaneously without additional calibration procedures and regulates the training trajectories and assistance accordingly. Results indicate the proposed method outperforms other training protocols, including the trajectory tracking control and the fixed cooperative control. The proposed control strategy provides an additional 66.25% motion deviation when estimated joint torque increases 12.36%, which enhances the training effectiveness and the interaction safety and promotes subjects' active engagement.

- (2022) Whole-Body Fuzzy Based Impedance Control of a Humanoid Wheeled Robot, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3151401.<br>
**Keywords**: Compliance and impedance control; humanoid robot systems; Humanoid robots; Impedance; Manipulator dynamics; Mobile robots; neural and fuzzy control; Robot kinematics; Robots; Torque; whole-body motion planning and control.<br>
**Abstract**: Humanoid robots can imitate human behaviour and provide interactive services to humans due to their humanoid form, especially humanoid wheeled robots that can perform more complex tasks with the additional mobility. With the development of robotics technology, humanoid robots have been used increasingly in the domestic environment where the robot needs to interact with unknown environments. This requires the robot to have both the ability to track with high accuracy and the ability to comply with complex environments. It is known that the robots with impedance control can have a superior performance in terms of compliance with unknown contact environments. However, the mobility of humanoid robots with wheels complicates the dynamic model of robots, which makes the development of impedance control challenging. In this letter, a whole-body impedance control approach for humanoid wheeled robots is proposed, with fuzzy adaptive systems to compensate for the uncertain dynamics of the controlled system. This approach realizes safe interaction and compliant operation with unknown environments including humans. Additionally, the experimental results conducted on a humanoid wheeled robot illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

**Abstract**: This article presents a computed-torque impedance control architecture for robotic-assisted mold polishing based on human skills.The mold polishing process for plastic injection is critical since tiny surface imperfections are easily visible in the plastic product, having strong implications in the overall quality. A Cartesian impedance control referred to the end-effector frame with posture optimization is proposed to tackle this problem. A collaborative robot manipulator from Franka Emika and a steel mold are used in the experiments to validate our approach. Human skills are captured both in comanipulation and free-hand modes, where position and force patterns are analyzed. Those patterns are then autonomously replicated by the robotic system, validating the proposed methodology.

**Keywords**: Attenuation; Couplings; deflection-domain control; Force; Impedance; Potential energy; Robots; Safety in HRI; Springs; telerobotics and teleoperation; variable impedance.<br>
**Abstract**: With emerging capabilities, robots will advance gradually into human environments in the near future. Thereby, safety and robustness is currently tackled through intrinsically soft robotics or variable impedances, mainly stiffnesses. In tele-operation, for instance, the control stiffness can be adapted to a measured arm impedance of the operator to stiffen the robot only when required for a manipulation task. Thus, humans or moving objects in the robot&#x2019;s environment are protected from hard collisions. Independent from its realization through hardware or software, the stability of the variation needs to be ensured through control strategies since energy is potentially introduced into the robotic system. This work presents a novel gradient-based passivity control concept for variable stiffnesses. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, the approach is based on a potential energy storage reference and prevents phases of zero stiffness through deflection-domain control. I.e., according to the energy storage, the stiffness variation over the spring deflection is controlled to ensure passivity. Experiments confirm the functionality of the approach and its robustness against delayed communication and active environments.

**Keywords**: Couplings; End effectors; Force; Impedance; impedance control; Multi-robot systems; object manipulation; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: There exist robotic tasks such as cumbersome object manipulation for which one arm alone is not sufficient and a team of robots should be employed. For such a multi-manual system, a control policy must be defined to meet the task objective. This letter presents a modular uni-arm control law for a multi-manual object manipulation task. Following the concept of force and impedance control, a novel adaptation policy is introduced which mitigates the intrinsic limitations of conventional methods such as the coupled impedance and hybrid position/force control approaches. To ensure the stability of the proposed control algorithm, passivity analysis is performed and a virtual energy tank is augmented to the multi-manual system. Finally, a set of experiments with a bi-manual setup manipulating an object is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed control approach.

**Abstract**: Human&#x2013;robot interaction has been widely studied, where compliant and safe human&#x2013;robot interaction of continuum manipulators in the constrained environment is one of the key issues that have not been well addressed. In this study, finite-time observer-based variable impedance control of cable-driven continuum manipulators (CDCM) is proposed to overcome the limitation of existing methods. First, the pseudo-rigid modeling method is utilized to establish the kinematics and dynamics of the CDCM. Then, a variable impedance controller with selected controller parameters for the CDCM is designed to realize compliant and safe human&#x2013;robot interaction operations with force&#x2013;position coupling constraint, which is rarely studied in the literature. In order to realize the closed-loop variable impedance controller, a finite-time observer is designed to estimate acceleration feedbacks, which can avoid the difficulty of directly sensing the interaction forces and shows excellent robust stability in noisy environments. On this basis, by combining the advantages of the variable impedance controller and finite-time observer, the finite-time observer-based variable impedance controller is proposed, and the stabilities of the proposed method are analyzed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme for the CDCM is demonstrated by some numerical simulations.

**Abstract**: This brief proposes an adaptive neural network-based finite-time impedance control method for constrained robotic manipulators with disturbance observer. Firstly, by combining barrier Lyapunov functions with the finite-time stability control theory, the control system has a faster convergence rate without violating the full state constraints. Secondly, the adaptive neural network is introduced to approximate the unmodeled dynamics and a disturbance observer is designed to compensate for the unknown time-varying disturbances. Then, the command filtered control technique with error compensation mechanism is used to deal with the “explosion of complexity” of traditional backstepping and improve the control accuracy. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

**Keywords**: Actuators; Anatomical stiffness prediction; biomimetic muscle actuators (BMA); End effectors; Impedance; impedance control; Koopman operator; Medical treatment; non-linear control; Parallel robots; Robots; Wrist; wrist rehabilitation robot.<br>
**Abstract**: Dynamic control of an intrinsically compliant robot is paramount to ensuring safe and synergistic assistance to the patient. This paper presents an impedance controller for the rehabilitation of stroke patients with compromised wrist motor functions. The control design employs a Koopman operator-based autodidactic system identification model to predict the anatomical stiffness of the wrist joint during its various degrees of rotational motion. The proposed impedance controller, perceiving the level of the subjects’ participation from their joint stiffness, can modify the applied force. The end-effector robot has a parallel structure that uses four biomimetic muscle actuators as parallel links between the end-effector and the base platform. The controller performance is corroborated by testing the end-effector robot with three healthy subjects.

**Keywords**: Autonomous impedance variation; Dynamics; Force; Impedance; nonlinear adaptive control; physical human–robot interaction (pHRI); Robot sensing systems; robot stability; Robots; Stability analysis; Task analysis; uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB).<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, a new learning-based time-varying impedance controller is proposed and tested to facilitate an autonomous physical human–robot interaction (pHRI). Novel adaptation laws are formulated for online adjustment of robot impedance based on human behavior. Two other sets of update rules are defined for intelligent coping with the robot’s structured and unstructured uncertainties. These rules ensure stability via Lyapunov’s theorem and provide uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system’s response, without a need for HRI force/torque measurement. Accordingly, the convergence of response signals, including errors in tracking, online impedance learning, robot parameter adaptation, and controller gain variation, is proven to operate in a bounded region (compact set) in the presence of robot and human uncertainties and bounded disturbances. The performance of the developed intelligent impedance-varying control strategy is investigated through comprehensive experimental studies in a repetitive following task with a moving target.

**Keywords**: Admittance control; human strength augmentation; Load modeling; multi-objective complementary control; passivity; Picture archiving and communication systems; Regulators; Robustness; Torque; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: For the position-error feedback-based admittance control in human strength augmentation, there are inherent conflicts among different performances, such as accuracy, passivity, and robustness. In this article, we propose a multi-objective complementary control framework that enables decoupled nominal admittance performance and robustness while preserving the passivity. Essentially, the framework consists of three parts. An linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) controller and a feedforward controller, which jointly render the nominally accurate and passive admittance performance against noise, and a robust regulator, which recovers the nominal performance when disturbance and/or uncertainty exist. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified on a human arm strength augmentation device for load lifting. Compelling simulations, experiments, and comparison results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method.

- (2022) Damping Selection for Cartesian Impedance Control With Dynamic Response Modulation, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2021.3116855.<br>
**Keywords**: Damping; dynamic response; Dynamics; Impedance; impedance control; Manipulator dynamics; Null space; redundant robots; stiffness; Vibrations; Xenon.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents an analytical method to modulate the dynamic response of a robotic manipulator interacting with its environment when performing impedance-related robotic tasks, through the choice of stiffness and damping parameters. By joint space analysis of vibration and experiments, we prove that in order to preserve a desired dynamic behavior of the robot in the Cartesian space, neither a stiffness nor damping matrix can be arbitrarily chosen; this choice has to meet the desired dynamic criteria for any given configuration. After mapping the parameters (matrices) into the joint space, we analyze the vibratory dynamics of the robot and identify the proper way of suppressing of the vibration modes by specific elements in the Cartesian damping matrix without need of trial and error. Our method is especially useful for redundant robots. We show and compare experimental results from two different 7 degrees of freedom robotic manipulators.

- (2022) Spherical Wrist With Hybrid Motion-Impedance Control for Enhanced Robotic Manipulations, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2021.3099310.<br>
**Keywords**: Control systems; Impedance; Impedance/admittance control; robotic wrist; Robots; Rotors; spherical motor; spherical wrist; Switches; Torque; Wrist.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a back-drivable spherical wrist with smart compliance for rendering human wrist-like capabilities in robotic applications. In order to synthetically impose both motion accuracy and active compliance for dedicated wrist manipulations, a robust hybrid control method is proposed that can switch between motion control (at free motion) and impedance control (at interactions with the environment). A sliding manifold is formulated so that when the control law drives the sliding manifold to zero, the motion/impedance errors will automatically converge to bounded regions despite system uncertainties/inaccuracies. Due to the direct-drive configuration of the proposed spherical wrist, the contact torque can be precisely estimated with an observer, providing an intuitive criterion of contact based on which the control modes can switch autonomously without external force/torque sensors and predefined geometric boundaries that are usually required in conventional hybrid force/position control. The concept is validated on a spherical wrist test-bed in the context of a throat swabbing process. The performance of the hybrid motion-impedance control evaluated against conventional impedance and admittance control methods demonstrate that the proposed spherical wrist enables a robotic system with both fine manipulations and smooth compliant interactions in wrist space.

- (2022) Fuzzy Enhanced Adaptive Admittance Control of a Wearable Walking Exoskeleton With Step Trajectory Shaping, **in** *IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TFUZZ.2022.3162700.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptive fuzzy control; admittance control; Exoskeletons; Force; Hip; Legged locomotion; Robot kinematics; Robots; step trajectory shaping; Trajectory; walking exoskeleton.<br>
**Abstract**: The generation of motor adaptation in response to mechanical perturbation during human walking is seldom considered in an exoskeleton system. Reshaping step trajectory over consecutive gait cycles for a walking exoskeleton is investigated in this article. Step adjustment of a walking exoskeleton can adapt to human walking intention by shaping step trajectory. This work develops an admittance adaptive fuzzy control strategy for a walking exoskeleton robot to provide assistance for human lower limb movement. Considering human walking intention and utilizing an admittance model, it shapes a reference trajectory to ensure that the walking exoskeleton follows it according to the human–robot force produced by its wearer. Considering a nonlinear and dynamic model with uncertainties, this work designs an integral-type Lyapunov function controller to track a reference trajectory. A disturbance observer is integrated into the controller design to compensate for uncertain disturbance in order to achieve an effective tracking performance. Finally, this work conducts experiments on two healthy subjects with the proposed method on a walking exoskeleton to validate its effectiveness. The results show that it can be applied to walking exoskeletons to enhance human mobility.

**Keywords**: Damping; DC motors; Energy harvesting; Force; Integrated circuit modeling; Resistors; seat suspension; Suspensions (mechanical systems); variable admittance (VA); variable damping (VD); variable inertance (VI); vibration control; Vibrations.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes a novel semiactive electromagnetic device with the capability of variable inertance and damping (VIVD) and an energy storage priority control (ESPC) strategy for vibration reduction of vehicle seat suspensions. The VIVD device can control its inertance and damping by adjusting resistances in a variable admittance (VA) circuit different from the traditional mechanical damper. The circuit and mechanical dynamics model of the VIVD seat suspension is analyzed and verified with tests, and the energy storage characteristic and controllability of the VIVD device are explored. Also, the frequency response characteristics of the VIVD device are derived from the admittance characteristics of the VA circuit. For the semiactive VIVD seat suspension, an H∞ controller is designed to obtain the desired control force. An ESPC strategy is proposed to make the electromagnetic force of the VIVD device track the desired control force. The test results show that the VIVD seat suspension can successfully suppress the seat's vibration, which is better than the traditional variable damping seat suspension performance. Under the random excitation, the root means square acceleration of the VIVD seat is reduced by 32.99% compared with a passive seat. This new semiactive VIVD device shows great potential in engineering applications.

**Keywords**: Automated craniotomy (AMC); bio-impedance measurement; breakthrough detection; closed-loop control; Drilling; Electric variables measurement; Electrodes; Impedance; Real-time systems; Sensors; Surgery.<br>
**Abstract**: Cranial microsurgery is a prerequisite for neuroscience research, which provides an accessible brain for neural recording and optogenetic stimulation. As the scale of electrode implantation increases, massive delicate craniotomies are required to perform on the submillimeter-thick skull of small animals (e.g., mice). Automated craniotomy (AMC) is ideal for improving surgery efficiency and ensuring consistent results. However, due to the lack of effective feedback, the current AMC platforms are prone to over-drilling and injuring brain tissues. Fragile and ultrathin skulls of small objects also make it hard to integrate suitable sensors into the end-effector for accurate perception. Thus, this article proposes an integrated electrical bioimpedance measurement (EBIM) solution for the closed-loop AMC. A sensing drill and a custom EBIM device are implemented to form reliable electrical contact with the object and accurately measure the impedance. After evaluating the EBIM device’s accuracy (< 2% relative error) and stability, we provide a modified judgment signal for breakthrough detection and further simulate closed-loop craniotomies on an equivalent model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve sensitive breakthrough detection (< 0.1 s delay at 100 Hz excitation) and consistent drilling depth ( $10.3 \mu 	ext{m}$  deviation with a 10-mm/min feed rate) in contrast to the gold standard (LCR meter).

- (2022) Development of an Untethered Adaptive Thumb Exoskeleton for Delicate Rehabilitation Assistance, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2022.3180832.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptive mechanism; Exoskeletons; Grasping; interaction force; Patient rehabilitation; rehabi litation; Robot kinematics; Robots; Stroke (medical condition); Thumb; thumb exoskeleton.<br>
**Abstract**: Robot-assisted thumb rehabilitation can improve the hand function of stroke patients because the thumb accounts for 40% of hand function. However, existing thumb rehabilitation robots are limited in terms of portability, comfort, adaptability, and independent joint actuation. This article proposes an untethered adaptive thumb exoskeleton that actively assists the 3-degree-of-freedom movements of the thumb. The exoskeleton is composed of an adaptive thumb mechanism and a spherical mechanism. The kinematics, statics, and performances of the adaptive thumb mechanism and the spherical mechanism are analyzed. Experimental validation is performed to test the workspace, self-alignment, interaction forces, admittance controller, and grasping assistance performance of the exoskeleton. The workspace and self-aligning experiments prove that the proposed exoskeleton can achieve a large workspace of the thumb joints and realize self-alignment. The interaction force experimental results show that the exoskeleton can reduce the tangential interaction forces by 76.8% and improve comfort. Finally, the control and delicate grasping assistance experiments validate the exoskeleton’s ability to realize the delicate grasping of the thumb. These characteristics show that the thumb exoskeleton has the potential to assist delicate thumb rehabilitation.

- (2022) An Optimal Variable Impedance Control With Consideration of the Stability, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3141759.<br>
**Keywords**: demonstration learning; Heuristic algorithms; Impedance; Optimization; Robots; stability and optimality; Stability criteria; Task analysis; Trajectory; Variable impedance control.<br>
**Abstract**: This letter presents an approach to develop a variable impedance controller with considerations of the optimality and stability. Firstly, an original optimal variable law is designed via demonstration learning, through which the Gaussian mixture model/Gaussian mixture regression (GMM/GMR) algorithm is employed to transfer the human impedance functions to the robot. By using the formulation of the GMR result, the regression task can be completed without using the ground-truth information of the human impedance parameters. To ensure the stability, a minimal complementary input is designed for the learned second-order impedance system. We transform the design problem to a constrained convex optimization problem, of which the constraints are related to a Lyapunov function. A criterion for choosing the Lyapunov functions is presented to ensure the feasibility of the problem, and an analytical solution is computed. The proposed approach is verified by the robotic-assisted rehabilitation and trajectory reproduction experiments conducted on a 7-DOF Franka Panda robot.

**Keywords**: Adaptive robust impedance control (ARIC); backstepping; energy-saving; Force; hydraulic excavator; Hydraulic systems; Impedance; impedance mode; Mathematical models; Oils; Soil; Valves.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, taking the hydraulic system of mining hydraulic excavator boom and stick as the plant, an adaptive robust impedance controller based on an extended state observer and backstepping method is designed. The energy-saving operation and position tracking performance are considered in system modeling and control law design. The system effects on electro-hydraulic proportional valves with open centers and flow regeneration valves (FRVs) are considered. When hydraulic cylinders are extended, the proposed control strategy adopts a pump-controlled pressure closed-loop to shorten the dead time. When hydraulic cylinders are retracted, less oil is output to meet the idle demand. The valve-controlled position subsystem with impedance mode ensures smoother digging processes. Comparative simulations show that the proposed control strategy has better position tracking and smaller velocity fluctuations. Compared with the system without FRVs, the proposed system can reduce energy consumption by 27.32%.

- (2022) Perturbation-Based Stiffness Inference in Variable Impedance Control, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3187866.<br>
**Keywords**: Compliance and impedance control; Force measurement; learning from demonstration; Manipulators; Perturbation methods; probabilistic inference; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: One of the major challenges in learning from demonstration is to teach the robot a wider set of task features than the plain trajectories to be followed. In this sense, one key parameter is stiffness, i.e., the rigidity that the manipulator should exhibit when performing a task. The required robot stiffness is often not known a priori and varies along the execution of the task, thus its profile needs to be inferred from the demonstrations. In this work, we propose a novel, force-based algorithm for inferring time-varying stiffness profiles, leveraging the relationship between stiffness and tracking error, and involving human-robot interaction. We begin by gathering a set of demonstrations with kinesthetic teaching. Then, the robot executes a perturbed reference, obtained from these demonstrations by means of Gaussian process regression, and the human intervenes if the perturbation makes the manipulator deviate from its expected behaviour. Human intervention is measured and used to infer the desired control stiffness. In the experiments section, we show that our algorithm can be combined with different types of force sensors, and provide suitable processing algorithms. Our approach correctly infers the stiffness profiles from the force and electromyography sensors, their combination permitting also to comply with the physical constraints imposed by the environment. This is demonstrated in three experiments of increasing complexity: a motion in free Cartesian space, a rigid assembly task, and bed-making.

- (2022) Characterization of Open-loop Impedance Control and Efficiency in Wearable Robots, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3150523.<br>
**Keywords**: actuators; Actuators; Brushless motors; control; Damping; Impedance; Mechanical impedance; robotics; Robots; Sensors; system identification; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: Wearable robots, such as bionic prostheses and exoskeletons, have been conventionally designed with low-torque, high-speed motors and high transmission ratios; however, recently designers are increasingly implementing high-torque, low-speed motors with lower transmission ratios. These motors were popularized by the drone industry and have transitioned to general use in robotics for their improved output impedance, efficiency, and lower audible noise. Due to the relative newness of these motors, there is a lack of information regarding how transmission dynamics affect the desired output impedance. In this study, we developed system identification techniques to characterize the output impedance (stiffness and damping) of these actuators operating without torque feedback, termed &#x201C;open-loop&#x201D; impedance control, a common control strategy employed in wearable robotics. Open-loop stiffness errors reached up to 42&#x0025;, but could be reduced to 2.9&#x0025; using a linear model based on our characterization. Second, we characterized the total efficiency across various power regimes, during both positive and negative work, and measured an average positive efficiency of 65&#x0025;. With these characterization experiments, we are able to better compensate for transmission losses, render more accurate impedance control, and operate actuators more efficiently. This work provides performance benchmarks and context for existing wearable robotic systems that implement similar open-loop control strategies.

- (2022) Understanding Modulation of Ankle Stiffness During Stance Phase of Walking on Different Ground Surfaces, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3191055.<br>
**Keywords**: Ankle impedance; assistive robotics; Impedance; impedance control; interaction control; Legged locomotion; lower extremity robots; Perturbation methods; Robots; Surface impedance; Task analysis; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: Understanding how human ankle mechanics are modulated when walking on various ground surfaces (e.g., soft and unstable ground surfaces) would help the development of controllers of lower extremity robots (e.g., prostheses and exoskeletons) mimicking human ankle behaviors. With this goal in mind, this study investigated how ankle stiffness in the sagittal plane is modulated throughout the stance phase of walking over different ground surfaces. A robotic platform, capable of simulating different mechanical environments, was used to quantify ankle stiffness in the sagittal plane during walking over compliant and rigid surfaces. The group average results of 10 healthy individuals showed that ankle stiffness increased with the progression of stance phase of walking but there was no significant environmental effect on the stiffness modulation. Further investigation into each individual subject revealed that surface compliance had an impact on the modulation of ankle stiffness in the later stance phase, which was significantly correlated with center of pressure position regardless of the surface condition (Pearson correlation coefficient: ∼0.93). Implications of the observed results for the development of continuous impedance controllers for lower extremity robots are discussed.

- (2022) Exploiting Redundancy to Facilitate Physical Interaction, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2021.3086632.<br>
**Keywords**: Biological control systems; End effectors; Impedance; Kinematics; manipulators; optimal control; Redundancy; robot control; Robots; Task analysis; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: The control of kinematically redundant robots is often approached using nullspace projection, which requires precise models and can be computationally challenging. Humans have many more degrees of freedom than are required to accomplish their tasks, but given neuromechanical limitations, it seems unlikely that biology relies on precise models or complex computation. An alternative biologically inspired approach leverages the compositionality of mechanical impedance. In theory, nullspace projection eliminates any conflict between two tasks. In contrast, superposition of task-space impedance and a full-rank joint-space impedance may impose a task conflict. This work compared nullspace projection with impedance superposition during unconstrained motion and forceful physical interaction. In practice, despite their theoretical differences, we did not observe a substantial influence of the nullspace projector weighting matrix. We found that nullspace projection and impedance superposition both resulted in measurable task conflict. Remarkably, when the dimensionality of the nullspace was increased, impedance superposition was comparable to nullspace projection.

- (2022) Toward Safe Human–Robot Interaction: A Fast- Response Admittance Control Method for Series Elastic Actuator, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2021.3057883.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Admittance control; delay compensation; Delay effects; Delays; Force; Hydraulic systems; Impedance; manufacturing automation; Robots; series elastic actuator (SEA).<br>
**Abstract**: Series elastic actuator (SEA) is a promising compliance device due to its lower output mechanical impedance, and it is widely applied to ensure safe human–robot interaction. Although some efforts have been made to achieve accurate stiffness tracking, the time-delay issue in SEA control has still not been well investigated. However, the time delay can cause an inaccurate response and increase the risk of injury. To overcome this problem, this article proposes a fast-response admittance control method for SEAs. First, an admittance control scheme considering the external force estimation is developed for a hydraulic SEA. Then, a parallel adaptive time-series (ATS) (P-ATS) compensator is proposed and further adopted in the admittance control scheme to compensate for the time delay and tracking error. The P-ATS compensator is a modification of the ATS compensator, which is enhanced with a unique parallel mechanism. Such a mechanism can save more computational resources on locating better parameters the for P-ATS compensator, thus improving its performance. Moreover, the parameter setting is converted to an optimization task, which is solved by the whale swarm algorithm (WSA) to achieve higher accuracy. The newly located parameters are compared to the current parameters based on a proposed evaluation criterion, thus guaranteeing the quality of the updated parameters. All the above strategies are employed to improve the SEA admittance control performance. The results obtained from both simulation and real-world experiments validate that, compared to conventional methods, the proposed method achieves a better performance in SEA stiffness tracking with lower time delay and tracking error. Note to Practitioners—Accurate stiffness tracking of SEAs can achieve safe human–robot interaction. However, the time delays introduced by the imprecise movement and estimation of external force can lead to inaccurate actuator response that may limit the capacity of safety insurance. To overcome this issue, a fast-response admittance control method is proposed for SEAs by adopting a novel P-ATS compensator. Thus, the time delays and errors from both load movement and external force estimation can be adaptively compensated. Several strategies have been adopted to enhance the compensator for parameter determination to achieve better performance. The proposed method requires no additional previous information about the system except load mass and spring stiffness, which makes it easy to implement for different types of SEAs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve faster and more accurate stiffness tracking under different conditions. Future work aims to address the control problem under random disturbances and apply the proposed method to human–robot collaboration tasks to further test its performance.

**Keywords**: compliance and impedance control; Cost function; Impedance; Kinematics; Knee; learning from demons- tration; Legged locomotion; Reinforcement learning; Robots; Tuning; wearable robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: Recent efforts in the design of intelligent controllers for configuring robotic prostheses have demonstrated new possibilities in improving mobility and restoring locomotion for individuals with lower-limb disabilities. In these efforts, personalizing the controller of the robotic device is a crucial step in order to meet individual user's needs and physical conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) based control designs are among some of the most promising approaches to achieving real-time, optimal adaptive tuning capability. However, such designs to date rely on subjectively determining human-robot walking performance measures, commonly in a quadratic form. To further automate the RL design for robotic knee control parameter tuning and potentially improve human-robot locomotion performance, this study introduces a new bilevel optimization method to objectively specify such control design performance measures via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which in turn, will be used in low level (forward) RL design of the impedance control parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel optimization approach with improved human-robot walking performance using systematic OpenSim simulation studies.

**Keywords**: admittance; Admittance; Control systems; Iron; Lyapunov; Muscles; nonlinear; passivity; rehabilitation; Switches; Torque; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: Motorized functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling can serve as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals affected by neurological injuries. It is unique among human-robot interaction tasks because the cycle's motor must be simultaneously controlled alongside the rider's leg muscles (using neuromuscular electrical stimulation). In this letter, two tracking objectives are proposed for the FES cycle: 1) stimulate the rider's leg muscles to track a desired cadence, and 2) use the cycle's motor to indirectly track a desired torque with an adaptive admittance controller. A combined Lyapunov and passivity based switched systems stability analysis is conducted to prove the cycle's motor is able to globally exponentially track the admittance trajectory and stabilize the overall system. Additionally, this letter showcases a method for the rider to smoothly enable and disable torque tracking. Experiments are presented on four participants to show the efficacy of the controllers.

**Keywords**: Deep-Gaussian-process (DGP)-based gait prediction; Delays; Exoskeletons; extend-state observer (ESO); human-exoskeleton cooperative motion; Impedance; measurement delay; Task analysis; Torque; Trajectory; Uncertainty; variable admittance controller.<br>
**Abstract**: The measurement delay of the feedback control system is a universal problem in industrial engineering, which will degrade output performance, especially causing undesirable chatter responses. In this study, a deep-Gaussian-process (DGP)-based method for operator's gait prediction is proposed to estimate the real-time motion intention and to compensate for the measurement delay of the inertial measurement unit (IMU). On the basis of these gait prediction uncertainties quantified by the DGP method, a variable admittance controller is designed to reduce real-time human-exoskeleton interaction torque. The reference trajectory is generated by the admittance controller, which is smoothed by the two-order Bessel interpolation. Meanwhile, the admittance parameters are self-regulated based on the defined uncertainty index of gait prediction. The extend-state observer (ESO) with backstepping iteration is adopted to compensate unmeasured system state, model uncertainties, and unmodeled dynamics of lower limb exoskeleton. The effectiveness of the proposed gait prediction and control scheme is verified by both the comparative simulations and experimental results of the human-exoskeleton cooperative motion.

**Abstract**: In this survey, various concepts and methodologies developed over the past two decades for varying and learning the impedance or admittance of robotic systems that physically interact with humans are explored. For this purpose, the assumptions and mathematical formulations for the online adjustment of impedance models and controllers for physical human–robot interaction (HRI) are categorized and compared. In this systematic review, studies on: 1) variation and 2) learning of appropriate impedance elements are taken into account. These strategies are classified and described in terms of their objectives, points of view (approaches), and signal requirements (including position, HRI force, and electromyography activity). Different methods involving linear/nonlinear analyses (e.g., optimal control design and nonlinear Lyapunov-based stability guarantee) and the Gaussian approximation algorithms (e.g., Gaussian mixture model-based and dynamic movement primitives-based strategies) are reviewed. Current challenges and research trends in physical HRI are finally discussed.

**Keywords**: Collaboration; Error constraint; Force feedback; Human-robot interaction; human–robot co-transportation; input constraint; Neural networks; neural networks (NNs); Robot sensing systems; Robots; vision and force sensing.<br>
**Abstract**: Human–robot co-transportation allows for a human and a robot to perform an object transportation task cooperatively on a shared environment. This range of applications raises a great number of theoretical and practical challenges arising mainly from the unknown human–robot interaction model as well as from the difficulty of accurately model the robot dynamics. In this article, an adaptive impedance controller for human–robot co-transportation is put forward in task space. Vision and force sensing are employed to obtain the human hand position, and to measure the interaction force between the human and the robot. Using the latest developments in nonlinear control theory, we propose a robot end-effector controller to track the motion of the human partner under actuators’ input constraints, unknown initial conditions, and unknown robot dynamics. The proposed adaptive impedance control algorithm offers a safe interaction between the human and the robot and achieves a smooth control behavior along the different phases of the co-transportation task. Simulations and experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed techniques in a co-transportation task.

**Abstract**: In this article, a novel underactuated finger exoskeleton is designed to assist grasping tasks for the elderly with weak muscle strength. In mechanical design, the human finger’s phalanges and joints are considered as part of the kinematic chains to realize the human-robot kinematic compatibility. The proposed finger exoskeleton achieves the finger preshaping and grasps objects with generic shapes. The proposed exoskeleton is both actively and passively backdriveable. Moreover, the weight of the wearable part of the proposed exoskeleton is 127 g, and the overall weight is 476 g, which indicates the proposed exoskeleton is lightweight and portable. To improve the grasping performance, the multiobjective genetic algorithm is implemented to optimize contact forces, which is to maximize the sum of the forces exerted on the index finger phalanges by the exoskeleton and to minimize the difference between the contact forces. After optimization, the sum of contact forces is risen by 15%, and the difference between forces is decreased by 53%. Furthermore, the admittance control is applied to make the proposed finger exoskeleton more compliant in the preshaping phase, and the admittance control is also implemented to achieve the fingertip grasping force control in the grasping phase. Finally, experiments have been conducted to verify the range of motion, grasping forces, and feasibility of the proposed index finger exoskeleton. The effectiveness of the control algorithm has also been verified by experiments.

**Keywords**: Adaptive control; Admittance; admittance control; Artificial neural networks; Impedance; Learning systems; Manipulators; neural networks (NNs); reinforcement learning (RL); robot–environment interaction; Trajectory; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, an adaptive admittance control scheme is developed for robots to interact with time-varying environments. Admittance control is adopted to achieve a compliant physical robot–environment interaction, and the uncertain environment with time-varying dynamics is defined as a linear system. A critic learning method is used to obtain the desired admittance parameters based on the cost function composed of interaction force and trajectory tracking without the knowledge of the environmental dynamics. To deal with dynamic uncertainties in the control system, a neural-network (NN)-based adaptive controller with a dynamic learning framework is developed to guarantee the trajectory tracking performance. Experiments are conducted and the results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- (2022) Identification of Hip and Knee Joint Impedance During the Swing Phase of Walking, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3172497.<br>
**Keywords**: Stiffness; Identification (control systems); Exoskeleton (Robotics); Joints (anatomy); Decision making.<br>
**Abstract**: Knowledge on joint impedance during walking in various conditions is relevant for clinical decision-making and the development of robotic gait trainers, leg prostheses, leg orthotics and wearable exoskeletons. Whereas ankle impedance during walking has been experimentally assessed, knee and hip joint impedance during walking have not been identified yet. Here we developed and evaluated a lower limb perturbator to identify hip, knee and ankle joint impedance during treadmill walking. The lower limb perturbator (LOPER) consists of an actuator connected to the thigh via rods. The LOPER allows to apply force perturbations to a free-hanging leg, while standing on the contralateral leg, with a bandwidth of up to 39 Hz. While walking in minimal impedance mode, the interaction forces between LOPER and the thigh were low (5N) and the effect on the walking pattern was smaller than the within-subject variability during normal walking. Using a non-linear multibody dynamical model of swing leg dynamics, the hip, knee and ankle joint impedance were estimated at three time points during the swing phase for nine subjects walking at a speed of 0.5 m/s. The identified model was well able to predict the experimental responses for the hip and knee, since the mean variance accounted (VAF) for was 99% and 96%, respectively. The ankle lacked a consistent response and the mean VAF of the model fit was only 77%, and therefore the estimated ankle impedance was not reliable. The averaged across-subjects stiffness varied between the three time points within 34-66 and 0-3.5 Nm/rad Nm/rad for the hip and knee joint respectively. The damping varied between 1.9-4.6 and 0.02-0.14 Nms/rad Nms/rad for hip and knee respectively. The developed LOPER has a negligible effect on the unperturbed walking pattern and allows to identify hip and knee impedance during the swing phase.  2001-2011 IEEE.

- (2022) Human-in-the-Loop Control of Soft Exosuits Using Impedance Learning on Different Terrains, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2022.3160052.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive control; Exoskeletons; Force; Friction; Human-in-the-loop adaption; Impedance; impedance learning; Legged locomotion; soft exosuit.<br>
**Abstract**: Many previous works of soft wearable exoskeletons (exosuit) target at improving the human locomotion assistance, without considering the impedance adaption to interact with the unpredictable dynamics and external environment, preferably outside the laboratory environments. This article proposes a novel hierarchical human-in-the-loop paradigm that aims to produce suitable assistance powers for cable-driven lower limb exosuits to aid the ankle joint in pushing off the ground. It includes two primary loop layers: impedance learning in the external loop and human-in-the-loop adaptive management in the inner loop. Considering unknown terrains, its impedance model can be transferred to a quadratic programming problem with specified constraints, which a designed primal-dual optimization prototype then solves. Then, the presented impedance learning strategy is introduced to regulate the impedance model with the adaptive assistant powers for humans on different terrains. An adaptive controller is designed in the inner loop to balance the nonlinearities and compliance existing in the human-exosuit coexistence, while the robust mechanism compensates for disturbances to facilitate trajectory management without employing the general regressor. The advantage of the proposed technique over conventional solutions with fixed impedance parameters is that it can improve human walking performance over different terrains. Experiments demonstrate the significance of the approach.

- (2022) Robust Admittance Control of Optimized Robot-Environment Interaction Using Reference Adaptation, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Netw. Learn. Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3131261.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP); Admittance; admittance control; Force; Impedance; neural networks (NNs); reference adaptation; robot-environment interaction; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, a robust control scheme is proposed for robots to achieve an optimal performance in the process of interacting with external forces from environments. The environmental dynamics are defined as a linear model, and the interaction performance is evaluated by a defined cost function, which is composed of trajectory errors and force regulation. Based on admittance control, the reference adaptation method is used to minimize the cost function and achieve the optimal interaction performance. To make the trajectory tracking controller robust to the unknown disturbance of internal system dynamics, an auxiliary system is defined and the approximation optimal controller is designed. Experiments on the Baxter robot are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive impedance control; Aerospace electronics; data-driven method; End effectors; Human-robot interaction; human-robot interaction (HRI); Impedance; Numerical simulation; reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning; velocity-free.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a novel data-driven design method for the human-robot interaction (HRI) system, where a given task is achieved by cooperation between the human and the robot. The presented HRI controller design is a two-level control design approach consisting of a task-oriented performance optimization design and a plant-oriented impedance controller design. The task-oriented design minimizes the human effort and guarantees the perfect task tracking in the outer-loop, while the plant-oriented achieves the desired impedance from the human to the robot manipulator end-effector in the inner-loop. Data-driven reinforcement learning techniques are used for performance optimization in the outer-loop to assign the optimal impedance parameters. In the inner-loop, a velocity-free filter is designed to avoid the requirement of end-effector velocity measurement. On this basis, an adaptive controller is designed to achieve the desired impedance of the robot manipulator in the task space. The simulation and experiment of a robot manipulator are conducted to verify the efficacy of the presented HRI design framework.

**Keywords**: Asymptotic stability; Force; force translation; Impedance; Impedance control; Jacobian matrices; Manipulator dynamics; multilateral teleoperation systems; Numerical simulation; numerical simulations; Numerical stability; sliding mode.<br>
**Abstract**: For the purpose of avoiding injury and realizing precise operations, the multilateral teleoperation system is the most efficient way to transport trace toxic or radioactive substances, to perform minimally invasive surgery, etc. It is essential to enhance the transparency of a multilateral teleoperation system including multiple masters and the single slave manipulator. However, there are few researchers focus on the allocation of the contact force of the single slave manipulator to different master manipulators. In this paper, we firstly introduce the concept of force translation for teleoperation systems consisting of dual hand master (left and right hands) manipulators and a single slave manipulator. Force translation reflects how the impedance on the single slave side is translated or allocated to contact forces on different master sides. To maintain the stability of the system and to improve transparency, we elucidate the mechanism of the force translation and analyze the relation among masters and the slave. Furthermore, the force translation mechanism is analyzed through numerical simulations and CHAI 3D virtual physical simulations. It is used to propose a multilateral impedance control, and the Lyapunov function is used to analyze the system stability. The results of numerical simulations and real robot experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methods based on the proposed force translation mechanism.

**Keywords**: Aerial systems: mechanics and control; compliance and impedance control; Friction; Impedance; machine learning for robot control; reinforcement learning; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Sensors; Surface impedance; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: The recent development of novel aerial vehicles capable of physically interacting with the environment leads to new applications such as contact-based inspection. These tasks require the robotic system to exchange forces with partially-known environments, which may contain uncertainties including unknown spatially-varying friction properties and discontinuous variations of the surface geometry. Finding a solution that senses, adapts, and remains robust against these environmental uncertainties remains an open challenge. This letter presents a learning-based adaptive control strategy for aerial sliding tasks. In particular, the gains of a standard impedance controller are adjusted in real-time by a neural network policy based on proprioceptive and tactile sensing. This policy is trained in simulation with simplified actuator dynamics in a student-teacher learning setup. The real-world performance of the proposed approach is verified using a tilt-arm omnidirectional flying vehicle. The proposed controller structure combines data-driven and model-based control methods, enabling our approach to successfully transfer directly and without adaptation from simulation to the real platform. We attribute the success of the sim-to-real transfer to the inclusion of feedback control in the training and deployment. We achieved tracking performance and disturbance rejection that cannot be achieved using fine-tuned state of the art interaction control method.

- (2022) Monitoring of Cylindrical Plunge Grinding Process by Electromechanical Impedance, **in** *IEEE Sens. J.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/JSEN.2022.3172230.<br>
**Keywords**: Electromagnetic interference; Electromechanical impedance; Electromechanical sensors; Impedance; Monitoring; piezoelectric transducers; plunge cylindrical grinding; Sensors; structural health monitoring; Surface impedance; surface roughness; Temperature sensors.<br>
**Abstract**: One of the most promising monitoring techniques is based on electromechanical impedance (EMI) transducers, which are low-cost components and allow easy implementation. EMI signal features showed good results for some applications in previous studies, but it is still unexplored for machining processes, which is essential for metal-cutting industries. This paper presents a new approach to verify the applicability of EMI measurements to monitor surface quality after the plunge cylindrical grinding of non-flat parts, which require low roughness and tight dimensional tolerances. Tests were carried out in a camshaft grinder and two low-cost piezoelectric diaphragms were attached to each workpiece to guarantee redundancy. Roughness  $	ext{R}_{\mathbf {a}}$  was also monitored to check existence of correlation with the EMI signals and relevant discussions regarding monitoring by EMI are presented. Results showed a great correlation between EMI measurement and surface roughness: 0.94 and 0.80 for both diaphragms. Since these diaphragms cost less than 1 US dollar and good correlation was verified, this monitoring system is promising to replace the traditional ones.

- (2022) Passive Impedance Control of Robots With Viscoelastic Joints Via Inner-Loop Torque Control, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2021.3071617.<br>
**Keywords**: Aerodynamics; Impedance; Impedance control; joint torque control; Robot sensing systems; series elastic actuator (SEA); series viscoelastic actuator (SvEA); Springs; Stability analysis; Torque; Torque control.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents passive impedance control of flexible joint robots (FJRs) via inner-loop torque control of elastic joints. However, according to our theoretical analysis, the torque control methods of series elastic actuators (SEAs) are often limited by the fact that the acceleration signals are amplified by the control gains. Since the acceleration signals are often affected by differentiation noise, the analysis may become invalid in practice. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the use of the so-called series viscoelastic actuator (SvEA), which significantly reduces the acceleration amplification. Consequently, in contrast to the SEA case, the theoretical analysis of an SvEA-based FJR is valid in real implementations. We would like to highlight the fact that the theoretical analysis (more specifically, passivity analysis) is performed for nonlinear robot dynamics without linearization. As a result, the passive impedance controller can be realized more robustly with enhanced inner-loop torque control.

- (2022) An All-Soft Variable Impedance Actuator Enabled by Embedded Layer Jamming, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2022.3183576.<br>
**Keywords**: Actuators; Brakes; Damping; Force; Impedance; Jamming; Layer jamming; Muscles; soft robotics; variable damping; variable impedance actuators (VIAs); variable stiffness.<br>
**Abstract**: Biological muscle is a multifunctional actuator capable of varying its stiffness and damping. The design of similarly multipurpose variable impedance actuators has benefits for improving physical robot interaction, such as by enabling variable impedance manipulators with more capability and greater safety. We present the concept for a soft jamming brake and artificial muscle (SJBAM). By incorporating a jamming brake inside of a pneumatic artificial muscle, we achieve synergistic benefits, which enable new functionalities, improve muscle static and dynamic response, and expand the brake’s capabilities. The SJBAM can store elastic energy, such as a pneumatic artificial muscle, and also act as a brake or clutch. By independently controlling the muscle and brake pressures, we can vary the SJBAM’s stiffness and damping. We derive models for this actuation concept and examine the performance of the SJBAM both theoretically and experimentally. In addition, we present open- and closed-loop position control demonstrations with a 1-degree-of-freedom manipulator actuated by an antagonistic pair of SJBAMs.

**Keywords**: Impedance; Impedance control; Kinematics; Knee; knee prosthesis; Legged locomotion; policy iteration; Prosthetics; rehabilitation robotics; reinforcement learning (RL); Robustness; Tuning.<br>
**Abstract**: Personalizing medical devices such as lower limb wearable robots is challenging. While the initial feasibility of automating the process of knee prosthesis control parameter tuning has been demonstrated in a principled way, the next critical issue is to improve tuning efficiency and speed it up for the human user, in clinic settings, while maintaining human safety. We, therefore, propose a policy iteration with constraint embedded (PICE) method as an innovative solution to the problem under the framework of reinforcement learning. Central to PICE is the use of a projected Bellman equation with a constraint of assuring positive semidefiniteness of performance values during policy evaluation. Additionally, we developed both online and offline PICE implementations that provide additional flexibility for the designer to fully utilize measurement data, either from on-policy or off-policy, to further improve PICE tuning efficiency. Our human subject testing showed that the PICE provided effective policies with significantly reduced tuning time. For the first time, we also experimentally evaluated and demonstrated the robustness of the deployed policies by applying them to different tasks and users. Putting it together, our new way of problem solving has been effective as PICE has demonstrated its potential toward truly automating the process of control parameter tuning for robotic knee prosthesis users.

- (2022) Shaping Individualized Impedance Landscapes for Gait Training via Reinforcement Learning, **in** *IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMRB.2021.3137971.<br>
**Keywords**: Assist-as-needed control; Force; Impedance; powered orthosis; rehabilitation robotics; reinforcement learning; robot-assisted gait training; Robots; Shape; Task analysis; Training; Trajectory; wearable robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: Assist-as-needed (AAN) control aims at promoting therapeutic outcomes in robot-assisted rehabilitation by encouraging patients’ active participation. Impedance control is used by most AAN controllers to create a compliant force field around a target motion to ensure tracking accuracy while allowing moderate kinematic errors. However, since the parameters governing the shape of the force field are often tuned manually or adapted online based on simplistic assumptions about subjects’ learning abilities, the effectiveness of conventional AAN controllers may be limited. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive AAN controller that is capable of autonomously reshaping the force field in a phase-dependent manner according to each individual’s motor abilities and task requirements. The proposed controller consists of a modified Policy Improvement with Path Integral algorithm, a model-free, sampling-based reinforcement learning method that learns a subject-specific impedance landscape in real-time, and a hierarchical policy parameter evaluation structure that embeds the AAN paradigm by specifying performance-driven learning goals. The adaptability of the proposed control strategy to subjects’ motor responses and its ability to promote short-term motor adaptations are experimentally validated through treadmill training sessions with able-bodied subjects who learned altered gait patterns with the assistance of a powered ankle-foot orthosis.

- (2022) Simultaneous Quantification of Ankle, Muscle, and Tendon Impedance in Humans, **in** *IEEE. Trans. Biomed. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TBME.2022.3175646.<br>
**Keywords**: Ankle impedance; Biomedical measurement; Impedance; Leg; muscle; Muscles; stiffness; system identification; System identification; tendon; Tendons; Ultrasonic imaging; ultrasound imaging.<br>
**Abstract**: Objective: Regulating the impedance of our joints is essential for the effective control of posture and movement. The impedance of a joint is governed mainly by the mechanical properties of the muscle-tendon units spanning it. Many studies have quantified the net impedance of joints but not the specific contributions from the muscles and tendons. The inability to quantify both muscle and tendon impedance limits the ability to determine the causes underlying altered movement control associated with aging, neuromuscular injury, and other conditions that have different effects on muscle and tendon properties. Therefore, we developed a technique to quantify joint, muscle, and tendon impedance simultaneously and evaluated this technique at the human ankle. Methods: We used a single degree of freedom actuator to deliver pseudorandom rotations to the ankle while measuring the corresponding torques. We simultaneously measured the displacement of the medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon junction with B-mode ultrasound. From these experimental measurements, we were able to estimate ankle, muscle, and tendon impedance using non-parametric system identification. Results: We validated our estimates by comparing them to previously reported measurements of muscle and tendon stiffness, the position-dependent component of impedance, to demonstrate that our technique generates reliable estimates of these properties. Conclusion: Our approach can be used to clarify the respective contributions from the muscle and tendon to the net mechanics of a joint. Significance: This is a critical step forward in the ultimate goal of understanding how muscles and tendons govern ankle impedance during posture and movement.

**Keywords**: Adaptive robust control; Aerospace electronics; Force; force control; Impedance; Manipulator dynamics; Manipulators; motion control; redundant robots; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Nowadays, higher requirements are placed on the design of the controller when robots enter the factory and co-operate with human. In this letter, we propose a unified task space control method combined with the contact reaction strategy in null space of redundant manipulator, which can not only conveniently switch between different control objectives according to specific tasks, but also react to the unknown contact with compliance. Specifically, the unknown contact force applied on the manipulator’s body is online estimated based on recursive least square estimation law in joint space. Then, the closed-loop dynamics of different control objectives are unified in task space by a generalized target model, and a model-reaching law based on adaptive robust control is proposed to achieve the target model even if there exists an unknown contact. Meanwhile, the estimated contact force is not only compensated in the model-reaching control law to guarantee the correct task execution but also used for the null space impedance control design to ensure compliant behavior. The performance and stability of the proposed scheme are guaranteed and proved in theory. Experiments are conducted on a 7-DoF manipulator for the validation.

- (2022) Detection and Estimation of Cognitive Conflict During Physical Human-Robot Collaboration, **in** *IEEE Trans. Cogn. Dev. Syst.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCDS.2022.3205168.<br>
**Keywords**: Admittance; Clocks; Electroencephalography; Games; Human-robot interaction; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Robots for physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC) often need to adapt their admittance and how they operate due to several factors. As the admittance of the system becomes variable throughout the workspace, it is not always straightforward for the operator to predict the robot’s behaviour. Previous work demonstrated that cognitive conflicts can be detected during one-dimensional tasks. This work assesses whether cognitive conflicts can also be detected during 2D tasks in pHRC and a classification problem is formulated. Different robot admittance profiles anticipating the stimulus translated into different levels of cognitive conflict. Several commonly used classification algorithms for EEG signals were evaluated to classify different levels of cognitive conflict. Results demonstrate that cognitive conflict level is lower when the admittance smoothly decreases before unexpected events when compared to conditions in which the admittance abruptly decreases before the stimulus. Among the classification algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network has shown the best results to classify different levels of cognitive conflict. Results suggest the feasibility of adaptive approaches for future pHRC control systems that close the loop on users through EEG signals. The detected human cognitive state can also be used to assess and improve the predictability of Human-Robot teams in various pHRC applications.

**Keywords**: Force; Force control; Impedance; Impedance control; Legged locomotion; parallel robot; Parallel robots; Robots; series elastic actuator; Training.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, a novel robotic device is proposed that can realize a large range of compliance and a force sufficient to achieve human-balance training. The proposed device is called a virtual ground robot (VGR) and consists of a 3-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism, which is driven by three series elastic actuators (SEAs). The proposed VGR can produce a large force and impedance overcoming the limitation of SEA using properly designed parallel legs, 3-PRRS, which can also reduce the size of the VGR. As a result, the proposed VGR can achieve 2.38-times stiffness ellipsoid as a conventional 3-RPS parallel robot. It can also achieve significantly large compliance by exploiting the advantages of SEAs, which have not been realized using conventional motion platforms. The dynamics and kinematics of the VGR are investigated from the SEA space to the entire task space, based upon which, the spatial impedance control of the VGR is designed by utilizing the robust force control of the SEA. The VGR is utilized as a device for measuring and training the balance of a human; a person can stand on the VGR, and balance-related values such as force, position, and center of the pressure are observed and controlled by the robot. The features and performance of the developed robot were theoretically examined and validated experimentally.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Balance reinforcement; exoskeleton; Exoskeletons; Hip; Impedance; impedance control; Modulation; Muscles; sit-to-stand (STS) movement; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: As an important movement of the daily living activities, sit-to-stand (STS) movement is usually a difficult task facing elderly and dependent people. In this article, a novel impedance modulation strategy of a lower-limb exoskeleton is proposed to provide appropriate power and balance assistance during STS movements while preserving the wearer’s control priority. The impedance modulation control strategy ensures adaptation of the mechanical impedance of the human–exoskeleton system toward a desired one requiring less wearer’s effect while reinforcing the wearer’s balance control ability during STS movements. A human joint torque observer is designed to estimate the joint torques developed by the wearer using joint position kinematics instead of electromyography or force sensors; a time-varying desired impedance model is proposed according to the wearer’s lower-limb motion ability. A virtual environmental force is designed for balance reinforcement control. Stability and robustness of the proposed method are theoretically analyzed. Simulations are implemented to illustrate the characteristics and performance of the proposed approach. Experiments with four healthy subjects are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show satisfactory results in terms of appropriate power assist and balance reinforcement.

**Keywords**: Assembly skill; Force; Hidden Markov models; Impedance; impedance control; learning from demonstration; movement primitives (MPs); Robots; Task analysis; Training; Trajectory.<br>
**Abstract**: The purpose of this article is to teach a robot assembly skills from demonstrations, and we attempt to train both the trajectory and the insertion force simultaneously. We encode human demonstrations data via motion primitives and, then, generate a reference trajectory and a prescribed force profile for a new assembly task using the combination of the motion primitives. We then propose an adaptive impedance controller to track the prescribed force with unknown environment stiffness, where the impedance parameters are estimated by the optimal solution of an equivalent linearization model. Our approach combines adaptive impedance control techniques with learning from demonstration on the same that makes it tractable and applicable to a real robot. Experiments on several typical noncylindrical parts illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Admittance; arbitrary-time convergence; Convergence; Force; Interaction control; nonlinear force observer; Observers; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; robotic manipulator; Robots.<br>
**Abstract**: In this brief, robot-environment interaction control problem of n-link robotic manipulator system without force sensors is investigated. At first, a novel sliding mode (SM) based two-layer adaptive force observer is proposed to estimate the robot-environment interaction force. In comparison with the most existing force observers, the proposed force observer ensures arbitrary-time convergence of the observer errors and relaxes assumptions on the external force. Moreover, an admittance controller is developed to ensure exact trajectory tracking within arbitrary time. It is mathematically proved that both trajectory tracking errors and force estimation errors will converge to zero at any setting time. Finally, numerical simulations and comparisons show that the proposed force observer-based control scheme can provide superior interaction performance.

- (2022) A Self-Tuning Impedance-Based Interaction Planner for Robotic Haptic Exploration, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3190806.<br>
**Keywords**: Compliance and impedance control; Impedance; integrated planning and control; Planning; planning under uncertainty; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory; Uncertainty.<br>
**Abstract**: This letter presents a novel interaction planning method that exploits impedance tuning techniques in response to environmental uncertainties and unpredictable conditions using haptic information only. The proposed algorithm plans the robot's trajectory based on the haptic interaction with the environment and adapts planning strategies as needed. Two approaches are considered: Exploration and Bouncing strategies. The Exploration strategy takes the actual motion of the robot into account in planning, while the Bouncing strategy exploits the forces and the motion vector of the robot. Moreover, self-tuning impedance is performed according to the planned trajectory to ensure compliant contact and low contact forces. In order to show the performance of the proposed methodology, two experiments with a torque-controller robotic arm are carried out. The first considers a maze exploration without obstacles, whereas the second includes obstacles. The proposed method performance is analyzed and compared against previously proposed solutions in both cases. Experimental results demonstrate that: i) the robot can successfully plan its trajectory autonomously in the most feasible direction according to the interaction with the environment, and ii) a compliant interaction with an unknown environment despite the uncertainties is achieved. Finally, a scalability demonstration is carried out to show the potential of the proposed method under multiple scenarios.

- (2022) Variable Impedance Skill Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3187276.<br>
**Keywords**: Aerospace electronics; Behavioral sciences; End effectors; Impedance; Machine learning for robot control; reinforcement learning; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory; variable impedance control.<br>
**Abstract**: Contact-rich manipulation tasks remain a hard problem in robotics that requires interaction with unstructured environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one potential solution to such problems, as it has been successfully demonstrated on complex continuous control tasks. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art methods require policy training in simulation to prevent undesired behavior and later domain transfer even for simple skills involving contact. In this paper, we address the problem of learning contact-rich manipulation policies by extending an existing skill-based RL framework with a variable impedance action space. Our method leverages a small set of suboptimal demonstration trajectories and learns from both position, but also crucially impedance-space information. We evaluate our method on a number of peg-in-hole task variants with a Franka Panda arm and demonstrate that learning variable impedance actions for RL in Cartesian space can be deployed directly on the real robot, without resorting to learning in simulation.

**Keywords**: Collaboration; Displacement sensor; Force; force balancing; Impedance; intuitive interaction; low-impedance interaction; physical human–robot interaction; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Sensors.<br>
**Abstract**: This article provides a general framework for the use of low-impedance displacement sensors mounted on the links of a serial robot to provide an intuitive physical human–robot interaction. A general formulation is developed to handle the motion guidance problem, i.e., the mapping of the measured motion of the sensors into the required robot joint motions to provide intuitive responsiveness. The formulation is general and can be applied to any architecture of serial robot with any number of displacement sensors each having an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom. Then, the design of a novel three-degree-of-freedom low-impedance displacement sensor is presented as a particularly effective instantiation of the general concept. Partial force balancing is used to reduce the required elastic return action, thereby ensuring the low impedance of the interaction. A prototype of a three-degree-of-freedom displacement sensor is then introduced. Two such sensors are mounted on the links of a custom-built five-degree-of-freedom robot in order to demonstrate the proposed approach. Experimental results are provided and comparisons with other collaborative robots are given. It is shown that the proposed sensors and motion guidance approach yield very intuitive low-impedance interaction involving very low interaction forces.

**Keywords**: Belts; Impedance; impedance control; Robot kinematics; Robots; Sanding robot; stability analysis; Stability analysis; structured-light technology; Surface impedance.<br>
**Abstract**: Sanding is a common yet important task in the manufacturing of many wooden objects (e.g. furniture, decoration box), where the coated layer attached on objects is removed after the interaction with sanding belts. Existing sanding operation is heavily dependent on manual works, which is highly labor-intensive and with the low consistency of quality, and the issues of safety and health also arise after continuous working in the noisy and dusty environment. To deal with the aforementioned, this paper presents the development of a new autonomous sanding robot. The autonomous capability of the developed robot is reflected in the whole procedure of sanding. In particular, the CAD model of the target object is automatically constructed with the structured-light technology, and the sanding behavior on the target surface is self-regulated under the desired impedance model. Such feature makes the robot capable of working towards uncertain objects with minimum human involvement. The proposed impedance controller has the model-free advantage, by using the adaptive neural networks (NNs) to compensate the uncertain dynamics and the unknown disturbances online. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved with Lyapunov methods, and experimental results on different objects are presented to validate the performance of the developed robot. The implementation of the developed robot can systematically address the problems associated with manual works. Note to Practitioners—The current working environment of sanding is not healthy or safe to humans, due to the nature of noise, dust, high-speed sanding belt. By controlling the robot to autonomously perform sanding tasks can keep humans away from such environment and hence systematically address the issues of health and safety. This paper presents a new impedance control method for sanding robot. In impedance control, the control goal is specified as a dynamic relationship between the contact position and the interaction force. In this paper, the contact position is determined by using the 3D vision sensor, while the interaction force is regulated by referring to the human experience. In addition, the influence caused by unmodeled factors (e.g. unknown dynamics of the sanded object) is also dealt with by using the techniques of NNs. Such setting can effectively guarantee the sanding quality and also avoid the physical damage to the sanded object. Therefore, it lays the foundation for the autonomous robotic sanding.

- (2022) Adaptive Robust Impedance Control for an Ear Surgical Device With Soft Interaction, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2021.3087014.<br>
**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Adaptive control; Analytical models; compliance control; Ear; Force; Impedance; medical devices; Performance evaluation; piezoelectric devices; robustness; Surgery.<br>
**Abstract**: The required suitably soft-contact interaction in certain surgical device applications brings great challenges on the force and position control because the soft-contact environment is nonlinear, viscoelastic, and inhomogeneous. In this article, a novel adaptive robust control approach, namely adaptive integral terminal sliding-mode-based impedance control (AITSMIC), is formulated to simultaneously regulate and control the position and force for a piezoactuated ear surgical device with soft interaction. First, the target impedance’s steady-state performance is discussed by utilizing the nonlinear Hunt–Crossley model. To achieve the desired impedance, an integral terminal sliding manifold based on the auxiliary variable containing the impedance error is proposed to improve tracking performance and obtain the required finite-time convergence. Furthermore, an adaptive law is designed to get rid of system nonlinearities, uncertainties and disturbances, and to retain high robustness. The stability of the proposed control system is proven via the Lyapunov theory. Significantly, implementing the AITSMIC is straightforward, where only essentially one uniform controller is applied. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of associated impedance parameters, verify the force-tracking performance and validate the suitably practical application of AITSMIC on the procedure of ear surgery with soft interaction. The results show that excellent tracking performance and successful operation are achieved by the proposed controller.

- (2023) Bayesian Optimization-Based Efficient Impedance Controller Tuning for Robotic Interaction with Force Feedback, **in** *IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIM.2023.3322504.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Impedance control is widely used in manipulation tasks of robots for the purpose of modulating the contact force between the robot and the interaction environment. Currently, it is achievable to adapt the impedance control parameters to various interactive objects via optimization or learning approaches. However, the adapt efficiency is still one of the most important unsolved challenges. In this regard, this paper presents a Bayesian optimization-based efficient tuning strategy for the impedance controller. The interaction process from impedance control parameters to the produced contact force is modeled as a Gaussian Process and the expected improvement plus (EIP) acquisition function is employed as a sampling criterion to tune the impedance control parameters. For interacting with objects, the efficiency and performance of the proposed method are numerically verified and compared with two classical adaptive impedance control schemes. With a real-world robotic manipulator, it is demonstrated that thanks to the inherent data efficiency of the Bayesian optimization, our method is able to find suitable impedance parameters via as few as a dozen of interaction attempts. Finally, the robustness of the proposed method against prior data is discussed.

- (2023) Human–Robot Role Arbitration via Differential Game Theory, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3320708.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: The industry needs controllers that allow smooth and natural physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) to make production scenarios more flexible and user-friendly. Within this context, particularly interesting is Role Arbitration, which is the mechanism that assigns the role of the leader to either the human or the robot. This paper investigates Game-Theory (GT) to model pHRI, and specifically, Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) and Non-Cooperative Game Theory (NCGT) are considered. This work proposes a possible solution to the Role Arbitration problem and defines a Role Arbitration framework based on differential game theory to allow pHRI. The proposed method can allow trajectory deformation according to human will, avoiding reaching dangerous situations such as collisions with environmental features, robot joints and workspace limits, and possibly safety constraints. Three sets of experiments are proposed to evaluate different situations and compared with two other standard methods for pHRI, the Impedance Control, and the Manual Guidance. Experiments show that with our Role Arbitration method, different situations can be handled safely and smoothly with a low human effort. In particular, the performances of the IMP and MG vary according to the task. In some cases, MG performs well, and IMP does not. In some others, IMP performs excellently, and MG does not. The proposed Role Arbitration controller performs well in all the cases, showing its superiority and generality. The proposed method generally requires less force and ensures better accuracy in performing all tasks than standard controllers. Note to Practitioners—This work presents a method that allows role arbitration for physical Human-Robot Interaction, motivated by the need to adjust the role of leader/follower in a shared task according to the specific phase of the task or the knowledge of one of the two agents. This method suits applications such as object co-transportation, which requires final precise positioning but allows some trajectory deformation on the fly. It can also handle situations where the carried obstacle occludes human sight, and the robot helps the human to avoid possible environmental obstacles and position the objects at the target pose precisely. Currently, this method does not consider external contact, which is likely to arise in many situations. Future studies will investigate the modeling and detection of external contacts to include them in the interaction models this work addresses.

- (2023) Transparent Control in Overground Walking Exoskeleton Reveals Interesting Changing in Subject’s Stepping Frequency, **in** *IEEE J. Transl. Eng. Health Med.-JTEHM*, **DOI**: 10.1109/JTEHM.2023.3323381.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Lower-limb gait training (GT) exoskeletons have been successfully used in rehabilitation programs to overcome the burden of locomotor impairment. However, providing suitable net interaction torques to assist patient movements is still a challenge. Previous transparent operation approaches have been tested in treadmill-based GT exoskeletons to improve user-robot interaction. However, it is not yet clear how a transparent lower-limb GT system affects user’s gait kinematics in overground walking, which unlike treadmill-based systems, requires active participation of the subjects to maintain stability. In this study, we implemented a transparent operation strategy on the ExoRoboWalker, an overground GT exoskeleton, to investigate its effect on the user’s gait. The approach employs a feedback zero-torque controller with feedforward compensation for the exoskeleton’s dynamics and actuators’ impedance. We analyzed the data of five healthy subjects walking overground with the exoskeleton in transparent mode (ExoTransp) and non-transparent mode (ExoOff) and walking without exoskeleton (NoExo). The transparent controller reduced the user-robot interaction torque and improved the user’s gait kinematics relative to ExoOff. No significant difference in stride length is observed between ExoTransp and NoExo (p = 0.129). However, the subjects showed a significant difference in cadence between ExoTransp (50.9± 1.1 steps/min) and NoExo (93.7 ± 8.7 steps/min) (p = 0.015), but not between ExoTransp and ExoOff (p = 0.644). Results suggest that subjects wearing the exoskeleton adjust the gait as in an attention-demanding task changing the rhythmic stepping to improve gait balance.

- (2023) Impedance Control of an Anthropomorphic Hands Without Finger Force Sensors, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3318513.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: With multiple fingers and multi-DOFs, an anthropomorphic hand can compliantly grasp objects with complex shape and low stiffness. In order to realize compliant grasp, contact force control between the anthropomorphic hand and the object is necessary. However, due to limited finger space for sensors and wiring, many anthropomorphic hands do not possess finger force sensors, so how to realize their compliant grasp control becomes a key issue. To solve this problem, this paper presents an impedance control method based on contact force observers and joint friction compensation for anthropomorphic hands without finger force sensors. A generalized momentum observer is used to estimate contact force, and an improved “static friction  $+$  Coulomb  $+$  viscous” model is adopted to realize joint friction compensation. The proposed impedance control method is verified both by simulations in Simulink and grasp experiments of an anthropomorphic hand. All the results show the method can not only estimate contact forces accurately and compensate joint friction, but also compliantly grasp objects with low stiffness and complex shape. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the demand for grasp control in anthropomorphic hands without finger force sensors. Force feedback is important in grasp control of anthropomorphic hands, but installing force sensors is highly challenging due to limited finger space for sensors and wiring, and the attendant consequences of increasing weight, volume and expenses. In order to realize such sensor-less grasp control, we present an impedance control method by calculating contact forces with a generalized momentum observer and estimating finger joint friction by an improved speed-friction model. Simulation studies and prototype experiments show the proposed method can stably grasp objects with varying stiffness and complex shapes while realizing expected dynamic characteristics. The proposed method can be used for other anthropomorphic hands without finger force sensors to improve their grasping capability. In future research, we will test the proposed method on more anthropomorphic hands without finger force sensors.

- (2023) Improving Sit/Stand Loading Symmetry and Timing Through Unified Variable Impedance Control of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis, **in** *IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3320692.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Individuals using passive prostheses typically rely heavily on their biological limb to complete sitting and standing tasks, leading to slower completion times and increased rates of osteoarthritis and lower back pain. Powered prostheses can address these challenges, but have control methods that divide sit-stand transitions into discrete phases, limiting user synchronization across the motion and requiring long manual tuning times. This paper extends our preliminary work using a thigh-based phase variable to parameterize optimized data-driven impedance parameter trajectories for sitting, standing, and walking, with only two classification modes. We decouple the stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand equilibrium angles through a knee velocity-dependent scaling term, reducing the model fitting error by approximately half compared to our previous results. We then experimentally validate the controller with three individuals with above-knee amputation performing sitting and standing transitions to/from three different chair heights. We show that our controller implemented on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis produced biomimetic joint mechanics, resulting in significantly reduced sit/stand loading symmetry and time to complete a 5x sit-to-stand task compared to participants’ passive prostheses. Integration with a previously developed walking controller also allowed sit/walk transitions between different chair heights. The controller’s biomimetic assistance may reduce the overreliance on the biological limb caused by inadequate passive prostheses, helping improve mobility for people with above-knee amputations.

- (2023) Outer-Loop Admittance and Motion Control Dual Improvement via a Multi-Function Observer, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIE.2023.3317843.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Safe environment contact, and high-performance motion control are typically conflicting design goals. Admittance control can improve safety and stability in contact with a stiff environment but remains challenging on industrial robots. Typically, high-performance motion control is achieved by low-admittance systems, which can give high transient forces or instability in contact with high-stiffness environments. This article proposes a linear admittance control framework from which a multifunction observer (MOB)-based control scheme that succeeds in directly improving the motion control accuracy by suppressing disturbances, while achieving better loop shaping in the outer-loop admittance control is designed. By using the task space force and position measurement of the robot, combined with linearized position-controlled robot and payload models to design the MOB, the outer-loop controller can render improved interactive dynamics. In addition, a methodology to design the proposed MOB based on the reduced-order model is developed. Furthermore, the bounded-magnitude frequency-domain uncertainty in the linear model is identified at a variety of robot poses. Theoretical evaluations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed MOB-based control method, in contact with a very stiff environment and with a 7-kg payload.

- (2023) Multimodality Driven Impedance-Based Sim2Real Transfer Learning for Robotic Multiple Peg-in-Hole Assembly, **in** *IEEE T. Cybern.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TCYB.2023.3310505.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Robotic rigid contact-rich manipulation in an unstructured dynamic environment requires an effective resolution for smart manufacturing. As the most common use case for the intelligence industry, a lot of studies based on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been conducted to improve the performances of single peg-in-hole assembly. However, existing RL methods are difficult to apply to multiple peg-in-hole issues due to more complicated geometric and physical constraints. In addition, previously limited solutions for multiple peg-in-hole assembly are hard to transfer into real industrial scenarios flexibly. To effectively address these issues, this work designs a novel and more challenging multiple peg-in-hole assembly setup by using the advantage of the Industrial Metaverse. We propose a detailed solution scheme to solve this task. Specifically, multiple modalities, including vision, proprioception, and force/torque, are learned as compact representations to account for the complexity and uncertainties and improve the sample efficiency. Furthermore, RL is used in the simulation to train the policy, and the learned policy is transferred to the real world without extra exploration. Domain randomization and impedance control are embedded into the policy to narrow the gap between simulation and reality. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, showcasing successful multiple peg-in-hole assembly and generalization across different object shapes in real-world scenarios.

- (2023) Retinal Surgical Field Realignment Based on Master-Slave Dual-Arm Surgical Robot, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3301277.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: In ophthalmic surgery, realigning retinal field is a common practice to check the lesion area by rotating the eyeball. It can be a challenging task for teleoperated surgical robots as it requests high precision of hands coordination comparing with traditional surgery. Current ophthalmic surgical robots are mainly designed with one-to-one mapping mode, which requires surgeons to operate with two hands. This article proposes a single master and dual-slave control method to improve the coordination of slave robots. Firstly, motion constraints between slave arms are analyzed. To solve the motion equation of master-slave mapping, Gauss-Newton Iteration is implemented to achieve the real-time motion coordination. Secondly, an adaptive impedance control is adopted to ensure the contact force between end-effectors and sclera within the threshold, preventing the eyeball from stretching and compressing. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are verified on the established ophthalmic surgical robot platform by fixed trajectory and free trajectory experiments. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of dual-arm control in robot-assisted retinal surgery. Related previous studies mainly focus on the control of teleoperated surgical robots based on one-to-one mapping mode between the master and slave robots. However, to the limited coordination of human hands, the master robots may perform poor coordination so that one task is hard to be accomplished by salve robots at same time. Especially when the requirement of task is complex and operation is precise, the accuracy and safety may not be guaranteed by one-to-one mapping mode. To solve these problems, this article seeks to develop a single master and dual-slave control method to improve the coordination of slave robots. The proposed method can be integrated into eye surgical robot to help the surgeons perform surgery. Our method will significantly facilitate its practical applications in improvement of surgery safety and reduction of the operation burden and training cost of the surgeons.

- (2023) Dexterous Robotic Cutting Based on Fracture Mechanics and Force Control, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3309784.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Skills of cutting natural foods are important for robots looking to play a bigger role in kitchen assistance. The basic objective of cutting is to achieve material fracture via smooth movements of a kitchen knife, which in the process performs work to overcome material toughness, acts against blade-material friction, and generates shape deformation. This paper investigates how a robotic arm drives the knife to cut through an object in a sequence of three moves: pressing, touching, and slicing. To cope with evolving contacts with the material and cutting board, position, force, and impedance controls act either separately or jointly, assisted by force sensing and/or based on fracture mechanics, so the knife follows a prescribed trajectory to split the object. Force data acquired during the phase of pressing are used for estimating the object-specific values of physical parameters related to cutting. These estimated values are promptly used for control purpose to execute the phase of slicing. Experiments over several types of fruits and vegetables have exhibited natural cutting movements resembling those performed by a human hand. Note to Practitioners—Automation of kitchen skills is an important step in the development of home robots, which are expected to relieve us from daily chores and help us care for the elderly and people with disabilities. The motivation of this research is to enable a robotic arm to cut natural foods with knife movements that bear the smoothness and efficiency of those executed by a human hand. Existing methods on robotic cutting have focused on force control to ensure material separation but not on execution of natural knife movements. This paper dissects a cutting action into three phases, as inspired from the human hand execution, and realizes them via different control policies. These policies are based on sensing and modeling the forces experienced by the knife through its interactions with the material and the cutting board. Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated cutting of various food items with speed and smoothness. In future research, we will address cutting of deformable objects and explore issues including energy efficiency, cutting by the knife held in a robotic hand, and food stabilization and manipulation by a second arm/hand.

- (2023) Efficient Incremental Offline Reinforcement Learning With Sparse Broad Critic Approximation, **in** *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TSMC.2023.3305498.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has been getting increasing attention in robot learning, benefiting from its ability to avoid hazardous exploration and learn policies directly from precollected samples. Approximate policy iteration (API) is one of the most commonly investigated ORL approaches in robotics, due to its linear representation of policies, which makes it fairly transparent in both theoretical and engineering analysis. One open problem of API is how to design efficient and effective basis functions. The broad learning system (BLS) has been extensively studied in supervised and unsupervised learning in various applications. However, few investigations have been conducted on ORL. In this article, a novel incremental ORL approach with sparse broad critic approximation (BORL) is proposed with the advantages of BLS, which approximates the critic function in a linear manner with randomly projected sparse and compact features and dynamically expands its broad structure. The BORL is the first extension of API with BLS in the field of robotics and ORL. The approximation ability and convergence performance of BORL are also analyzed. Comprehensive simulation studies are then conducted on two benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed BORL can obtain comparable or better performance than conventional API methods without laborious hyperparameter fine-tuning work. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of BORL in practical robotic applications, a variable force tracking problem in robotic ultrasound scanning (RUSS) is investigated, and a learning-based adaptive impedance control (LAIC) algorithm is proposed based on BORL. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LAIC compared with conventional force tracking methods.

- (2023) Robust Variable Impedance Control for Aerial Compliant Interaction With Stability Guarantee, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Inform.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TII.2023.3306574.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: This article investigates a robust variable impedance control methodology for aerial manipulators to realize compliant and safe interaction tasks. Considering that the stability characteristics are generally overlooked in existing variable impedance controllers of the aerial manipulator, state-independent stability conditions are applied for time-varying impedance profiles to ensure the exponential stability of the desired variable impedance dynamics (DVID) as well as the boundedness of the state variables in the DVID. A command trajectory variable is introduced for converting the impedance control issue to a particular tracking issue, and then, a robust variable impedance controller based on the wrench estimator is designed to guarantee the exponential convergence of the translational states and impedance error of the aerial manipulator. The designed impedance controller is structurally simple and results in low implementation costs. Next, an improved attitude control approach with the command filter is developed for global flight attitude stability without any singularities or ambiguities, where the filter is introduced to avoid computing the derivative signals of the generalized force input. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is illustrated via numerical simulations and interaction experiments with different targets in real scenarios.

- (2023) Design Considerations for the Development of Lower Limb Pediatric Exoskeletons a Literature Review, **in** *IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMRB.2023.3310040.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Cerebral Palsy is the most prevalent cause of gait disorder in childhood, affecting the range of motion, power, and joint torques of children. Several treatments are available, ranging from physical therapy to surgery. However, these treatments are usually complex, costly, and long. Robotic exoskeletons could provide longer, more frequent, and personalized training sessions with quantified data on the gait characteristics. Unfortunately, very few pediatric exoskeletons are available compared to those for adults. Therefore, design guidelines are needed for the development of pediatric exoskeletons to facilitate market entry. This article proposes design considerations through an in-depth review of the available pediatric lower-limb exoskeletons. This research has identified nine exoskeletons with at least one actuated joint at the ankle level and discussed their clinical, mechanical, and control characteristics. Although all the identified exoskeletons use electric motors to reduce their weight, improvements must be made to further minimize it. In addition, these exoskeletons need to be more easily adaptable to the user’s morphology. Impedance control methods are commonly used, which ensures the interaction safety. However, they should be more personalized to the specific neurological deficiencies. Furthermore, stronger validation of these exoskeletons is required through clinical trials.

**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Soft rehabilitation exoskeletons have gained much attention in recent years, striving to assist the paralyzed individuals restore motor functions. However, it is a challenge to promote human-robot interaction property and satisfy personalized training requirements. This article proposes a soft elbow rehabilitation exoskeleton for the multi-mode training of disabled patients. An adaptive cooperative admittance backstepping control strategy combined with surface electromyography (sEMG)-based joint torque estimation and neural network compensation is developed, which can induce the active participation of patients and guarantee the accomplishment and safety of training. The proposed control scheme can be transformed into four rehabilitation training modes to optimize the cooperative training performance. Experimental studies involving four healthy subjects and four paralyzed subjects are carried out. The average root mean square error and peak error in trajectory tracking test are 3.18° and 5.68°. The active cooperation level can be adjusted via admittance model, ranging from 4.51 °/Nm to 10.99 °/Nm. In cooperative training test, the average training mode value and effort score of healthy subjects (i.e., 1.58 and 1.50) are lower than those of paralyzed subjects (i.e., 2.42 and 3.38), while the average smoothness score and stability score of healthy subjects (i.e., 3.25 and 3.42) are higher than those of paralyzed subjects (i.e., 1.67 and 1.71). The experimental results verify the superiority of proposed control strategy in improving position control performance and satisfying the training requirements of the patients with different hemiplegia degrees and training objectives.

**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Objective: Although there have been studies conducted on the instantaneous remote center of motion (RCM) mechanism, the general closed-loop control method has not been studied. Thus, this paper fills that gap and employs the advantages of this mechanism to develop a novel injection system. Methods: The injection prototype involves the instantaneous RCM mechanism, insertion unit and injection unit. The RCM system is investigated in the presence of time-varying axial stiffness of the screw drive and underactuated case. For safe interaction, compliance control is designed in the insertion system. The stability of all separate systems is investigated with the bounded parameter variation rate. The injection prototype and a robot end-effector were then combined to perform injection. Results: Our RCM prototype can achieve a large workspace, and its control effectiveness was verified by multiple frameworks and comparison with previous studies. Compliance-controlled insertion can achieve accurate depth regulation and zero-impedance control for manually operating the needle. With the help of three-dimensional reconstruction and hand/eye calibration, the manipulator can guide the injection prototype to a proper pose for injection of a face model. Conclusion: The injection prototype was successfully designed. The effectiveness of the whole control system was verified by simulations and experiments. The particular robotic injection task can be performed by the prototype. Significance: This paper provides alternative schemes for developing an instantaneous RCM system, screw drive-based surgical tool, and robotic insertion with small needles.

- (2023) Robotic Skill Mutation in Robot-to-Robot Propagation During a Physically Collaborative Sawing Task, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2023.3307289.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Skill propagation among robots without human involvement can be crucial in quickly spreading new physical skills to many robots. In this respect, it is a good alternative to pure reinforcement learning, which can be time-consuming, or learning from human demonstration, which requires human involvement. In the latter case, there may not be enough humans to quickly spread skills to many robots. However, propagation among robots without direct human supervision can result in robotic skills mutating from the original source. This can be beneficial when better skills might emerge or when a new skill is obtained to be used for other similar tasks. However, it can also be dangerous in terms of task execution safety. This letter studies the mutation of a robotic skill when it is propagated from one robot to another during a physically collaborative task. We chose the collaborative sawing task as a study case since it involves complex two-agent physical interaction/coordination and because its periodic nature can facilitate repetitive learning. The study employs periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives and Locally Weight Regression to encode and learn the motion and impedance required to execute the task. To explore what influences mutation, we varied several control and environment conditions such as the maximum stiffness, robot base position, friction coefficient of the sawed object, and movement period. The results showed that the skill varied over propagation steps and we identified several key aspects of mutation such as movement length, movement offset, and trajectory shape. Based on the results we identified possible benefits (skill mutations useful for different settings or different tasks, and energy efficiency) and dangers (high forces and skill mutations becoming useless for the original task) of the mutation.

- (2023) Interactive Imitation Learning of Bimanual Movement Primitives, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2023.3295249.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Performing bimanual tasks with dual robotic setups can drastically increase the impact on industrial and daily life applications. However, performing a bimanual task brings many challenges, such as synchronization and coordination of the single-arm policies. This article proposes the safe, interactive movement primitives learning (SIMPLe) algorithm, to teach and correct single or dual arm impedance policies directly from human kinesthetic demonstrations. Moreover, it proposes a novel graph encoding of the policy based on Gaussian process regression where the single-arm motion is guaranteed to converge close to the trajectory and then toward the demonstrated goal. Regulation of the robot stiffness according to the epistemic uncertainty of the policy allows for easily reshaping the motion with human feedback and/or adapting to external perturbations. We tested the SIMPLe algorithm on a real dual-arm setup where the teacher gave separate single-arm demonstrations and then successfully synchronized them only using kinesthetic feedback or where the original bimanual demonstration was locally reshaped to pick a box at a different height.

- (2023) Abduction/Adduction Assistance From Powered Hip Exoskeleton Enables Modulation of User Step Width During Walking, **in** *IEEE. Trans. Biomed. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TBME.2023.3301444.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Using wearable robotics to modulate step width in normal walking for enhanced mediolateral balance has not been demonstrated in the field. We designed a bilateral hip exoskeleton with admittance control to power hip abduction and adduction to modulate step width. Objective: As the first step to show its potential, the objective of this study was to investigate how human's step width reacted to hip exoskeleton's admittance control parameter changes during walking. Methods: Ten non-disabled individuals walked on a treadmill at a self-selected speed, while wearing our bilateral robotic hip exoskeleton. We used two equilibrium positions to define the direction of assistance. We studied the influence of multiple stiffness values in the admittance control on the participants' step width, step length, and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the gluteus medius. Results: Step width were significantly modulated by the change of stiffness in exoskeleton control, while step length did not show significant changes. When the stiffness changed from zero to our studied stiffness values, the participants' step width started to modulate immediately. Within 4 consecutive heel strikes right after a stiffness change, the step width showed a significant change. Interestingly, EMG activity of the gluteus medius did not change significantly regardless the applied stiffness and powered direction. Conclusion: Tuning of stiffness in admittance control of a hip exoskeleton, acting in mediolateral direction, can be a viable way for controlling step width in normal walking. Unvaried gluteus medius activity indicates that the increase in step width were mainly caused by the assistive torque applied by the exoskeleton. Significance: Our study results pave a new way for future design and control of wearable robotics in enhancing mediolateral walking balance for various rehabilitation applications.

- (2023) Adaptive Force Tracking Impedance Control for Aerial Interaction in Uncertain Contact Environment Using Barrier Function, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3301023.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: In this article, an adaptive force tracking impedance control strategy is investigated for an aerial manipulator in physical interaction with uncertain contact environments. Based on the modified target impedance model, an adaptive impedance control method is proposed to accomplish aerial interaction in uncertain environments while maintaining a stable contact force, wherein the environment parameters of location and stiffness are estimated online to generate a reference position trajectory. Then, in order to ensure the tracking performance of the aerial manipulator, a robust pose tracking controller is designed, including a barrier function-based position controller and an adaptive attitude controller. Both proposed position and attitude controllers can ensure finite-time convergence of the state variable without the priori boundary information of disturbances. In particular, the position state variable can converge to a predefined neighborhood of zero from any initial state, and the control gain is not overestimated. The stability of the proposed strategy is analyzed via Lyapunov tools. Simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to illustrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed control strategy. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this article is to investigate an adaptive force tracking impedance control strategy for aerial physical interaction with uncertain contact environments. In the existing impedance control schemes for aerial manipulators, the environment parameter of location or stiffness is often required to be utilized in controller design. However, in practical cases, the environmental parameters are not known precisely. Thus, this article presents an adaptive impedance method to automatically generate the reference position trajectory and achieve a stable contact force. Additionally, the tracking performance of the aerial manipulator is inevitably subject to uncertainties and disturbances. To ensure tracking convergence, traditional robust controllers generally involve high control gains than the known upper bounds of the disturbances. The main disadvantage of those controllers is that the control gain is often overestimated when the disturbance decreases. To address this issue, a barrier function-based position controller is proposed for the aerial manipulator, where the priori boundary information of disturbances is not needed and the control gain is adaptively adjusted according to the amplitude of disturbances. The stability and convergence of the proposed strategy are analyzed mathematically, and the experiments using an aerial manipulator provide promising results.

**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Haptic upper limb exoskeletons are robots that assist human operators during task execution while having the ability to render virtual or remote environments. Therefore, ensuring the stability of such robots in physical human-robot-environment interaction (pHREI) is crucial. Having a wide range of Z-width, which indicates the region of passively renderable impedance by a haptic display, is also important for rendering a broad range of virtual environments. To address these issues, this study designs subsystem-based adaptive impedance control to achieve a stable pHREI for 7 degrees of freedom haptic exoskeleton. The presented controller decomposes the entire system into subsystems and designs the controller at the subsystem level. The stability of the controller in the presence of contact with a virtual environment and human arm force is proven by employing the concept of virtual stability. Additionally, the Z-width of the 7-DoF haptic exoskeleton is illustrated using experimental data and improved by exploiting varying virtual mass element. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the controller. The control results are also compared to state-of-the-art control methods, highlighting the excellence of the designed controller.

**Keywords**: Impedance; Machining; Force; Service robots; Robot sensing systems; Task analysis; Surface impedance; Intelligent and flexible manufacturing; moving horizon estimation; robot-environment interaction; robotic machining; variable impedance control.<br>
**Abstract**: Adaptability is one of the most important survival and living abilities in nature and human society, which needs to perceive the environment and regulate self-behaviors. To empower robots in manufacturing with this ability, an observer-based variable impedance control scheme is proposed in this article. It senses changes in environmental properties during contact and utilizes the observations to guide the decisions of the robot controller. Specifically, we developed a real-time moving horizon based robot-environment observer, which uses historical information to predict the current impedance parameters of the external contact environment and robot internal joint disturbances simultaneously. Then, a variable impedance control law is designed to eliminate state tracking errors and decrease machining vibration. The stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically proven. Experiments on machining thin-walled workpieces validate the efficacy of the proposed method, where the robot exhibits compliant force behavior resulting in superior workpiece surface roughness among various comparison methods.

**Keywords**: Force control; Force; Adaptation models; Position control; Trajectory; Uncertainty; Tracking loops; Model-free control; Barrier Lyapunov function; Adaptive control; Series elastic actuator; Hybrid position/force control.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, an adaptive time-varying barrier Lyapunov function-based model-free hybrid position/force controller (ABLF-MFC) is designed for a series elastic actuator (SEA)-based 2-link manipulator. The proposed ABLF-MFC is designed based on impedance control and has a dual-loop structure, which is an outer force control loop and an inner position control loop. The outer force control loop converts the desired interaction force into a reference trajectory through the impedance model, which is later tracked by the inner position control loop to achieve hybrid position and force control. In order to simplify the inner position control loop design, an ultra-local model (ULM) is introduced to approximate the original system, and all the dynamic characteristics and uncertainties are lumped into an unknown term. And the time-delay estimator (TDE) is used to estimate the unknown term in ULM. Then, a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function is introduced in the inner position control loop, which can effectively improve the transient and steady responses. In addition, an adaptive term is added to compensate for the estimation error of TDE. The effectiveness of the proposed ABLF-MFC is verified by rigorous mathematical proofs and simulation results.

- (2023) STMI: Stiffness Estimation Method Based on sEMG-Driven Model for Elbow Joint, **in** *IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIM.2023.3300424.<br>
**Keywords**: Estimation; Elbow; Muscles; Feature extraction; Time-domain analysis; Torque; Three-dimensional displays; Surface electromyogram (sEMG); joint stiffness; muscle activity; signal processing; feature extraction.<br>
**Abstract**: Human arm exhibits superb maneuverability in performing various tasks by utilizing its ability to actively adjust impedance parameters and interaction forces. Therefore, how to identify the joint stiffness of the arm during motion and transmit them to the exoskeleton robots is the key to achieving flexible rehabilitation motion. In this paper, we propose a stiffness estimation method for elbow joint, termed stiffness and torque mapping index (STMI), which establishes the relationship between joint torque, joint angle and joint stiffness based on surface electromyography (sEMG). To improve joint angle identification accuracy, we propose a regression algorithm (RA), termed improved ant colony optimization generalized regression neural network (IACO-GRNN), and propose a time-domain descriptor (TDD) sEMG feature. Feature comparison experiment show that the TDD features (RMSE: 7.9792±0.0721; R2: 0.9257±0.0020) are superior among the popular features such as mean absolute value (MAV), root mean square (RMS) and waveform length (WL). The combination of TDD and IACO-GRNN achieves more impressive regression performance (RMSE: 8.6839 ± 0.0084, R2: 0.9109 ± 0.0002) than RA in joint angle recognition experiments, such as support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), Particle swarm optimization-GRNN (PSO-GRNN) and Genetic algorithm-GRNN (GA-GRNN). The average RMSE of the joint stiffness estimated using STMI was 1.0146 Nm/rad. The proposed method can offer satisfactory dynamic elbow joint stiffness estimation only using sEMG signals, avoiding complex calibration of physiological data and additional sensing devices.

**Keywords**: Impedance; Cameras; Task analysis; Force; Optical imaging; Vehicle dynamics; Optical sensors; Aerial vehicles; image-based visual servoing; impedance control; input-to-state stability (ISS).<br>
**Abstract**: Existing works on the impedance control of aerial vehicles are generally based on the assumption of known translational velocity. However, velocity estimation can be unreliable in many cases. To solve this problem, we propose a concurrent velocity observation and impedance control framework to perform contact-based interaction tasks of aerial vehicles. This framework is cost-optimized since it only uses monocular vision and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements, without using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) modules, optical flow, and force sensors. Specifically, we propose a novel observer-based impedance model (VOIM) and a dynamic image-based visual servoing (DIBVS) controller to achieve the desired interaction behavior. Rigorous input-to-state stability analysis of the closed-loop system is subsequently conducted, proving the effectiveness of the method under unknown environment position and stiffness, along with the robustness to any positive estimate of the scale factor of visual features. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by implementing an aerial drawing task and a point-contact impedance-based force regulation task. Furthermore, the robustness under vision system uncertainties is tested, highlighting the potential of application in unstructured environments.

- (2023) Hybrid Force/Position Control for Switchable Unmanned Aerial Manipulator Between Free Flight and Contact Operation, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3294254.<br>
**Keywords**: Control systems; Switches; Task analysis; Stability analysis; Impedance; Robots; Estimation; Unmanned aerial manipulator; contact operation; switch system; contact force control; force estimation.<br>
**Abstract**: The refined aerial operations of the unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM) have been extensively studied for the last decades. Usually, UAM operations are accompanied by several phases, such as free flight, contact operations, and separation. A great challenge is proposed for switching operations in different environments and the high-precision contact force requirements of UAM control, so this paper conducts control stability research in the case of dynamic differences between free flight and contact operation for the UAM system. First, a hybrid force/position control strategy is proposed for switchable UAM system, among them, the adaptive sliding mode control method based on the interference observer is utilized in the free flight phase, and the adaptive impedance force control method is employed in the contact operation phase, where the adaptive estimation method is designed to perform on-board manipulator contact force estimation. Then a robust adaptive control strategy is proposed for the attitude loop to compensate for the torque disturbance generated during the contact operation phase. Meanwhile, the stability of the switching system is analyzed through the continuous Lyapunov function to prove the stability of the switching process. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed schemes are verified through contact operation simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the contact force tracking of an UAM without force sensor. In recent years, hybrid force/position control has been widely used in UAM. However, force measurement is required at the end-effector and the object in most studies. The proposed method divides the contact operation process into free flight and contact operation stages. In the free flight stage, it is not necessary to know the prior information of the environment accurately (i.e. the external disturbance of slowly varying or known upper bound), and the disturbance observer is adopted to compensate for the disturbance caused by the external environment. In the contact operation stage, the impedance force control method is used for force tracking, which reduces the complexity and quality of the end-effector. At the same time, The shock caused by the switch from free flight to contact operation is reduced by calculating the appropriate controller parameters using the Lyapunov function. The proposed method is a promising solution for real applications and is validated via simulation and indoor contact experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better stability and accuracy than the existing methods, and can be extended to industrial inspection, component processing, aerial operation, etc.

- (2023) Distributed Observer-Based Prescribed Performance Control for Multi-Robot Deformable Object Cooperative Teleoperation, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3292553.<br>
**Keywords**: Robots; Force; Dynamics; Observers; Jacobian matrices; Deformation; Torque; Cooperative teleoperation; multi-robot system; deformable object manipulation; barrier Lyapunov functions; distributed observer.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, a distributed observer-based prescribed performance control method is proposed for using a multi-robot teleoperation system to manipulate a common deformable object. To achieve a stable position-tracking effect and realize the desired cooperative operational performance, we first define a new hybrid error matrix for both the relative distances and absolute positions of robots and then decompose the matrix into two new error terms for cooperative and independent robot control. Then, we improve the Kelvin-Voigt (K-V) contact model based on the new error terms. Because the center position and deformation of the object cannot be measured, the object dynamics are then expressed by the relative distances of robots and an equivalent impedance term. Each robot incorporates an observer to estimate contact force and object dynamics based on its own measurements. To address the position errors caused by biases in force estimation and realize the position-tracking effect of each robot, we improve the barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) by incorporating the errors into system control. which allows us to achieve a predefined position-tracking effect. We conduct an experiment to verify the proposed controller’s ability in a dual-telerobot cooperative manipulation task, even when the object is subjected to unknown disturbances. Note to Practitioners—This article is inspired by the limitations of multi-telerobot manipulation with a deformable object, where the deformation of the object cannot be measured directly. Meanwhile, force sensors, especially 6-axis force sensors, are very expensive. To realize the purpose that objects manipulated by multiple robots match the same state as operated on the leader side, we propose an object-centric teleoperation framework based on the estimates of contact forces and object dynamics and the improved barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs). This framework contributes to two aspects in practice: 1) propose a control diagram for deformable object co-teleoperation of multi-robots for unmeasurable object’s centre position and deformation; 2) propose an improved BLFs controller based on the estimation of contact force and robot dynamics. The estimation errors are considered and transferred using an equivalent impedance to be integrated into the Lyapunov function to minimize both force and motion-tracking errors. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The developed framework can be used in industrial applications with a similar scenario.

- (2023) A Variable Impedance Scheme Based on Power-Shaping Signals and Partial Knowledge of Link-Side Dynamics for Flexible-Joint Robot Interaction and Tracking Control, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2023.3287789.<br>
**Keywords**: Robots; Robot kinematics; Impedance; Torque; Stability analysis; Damping; Computational modeling; Human-robot interaction; soft robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes a novel scheme—based on power-shaping control (PSC)—that can endow flexible-joint robots with both tracking, and interactional, capabilities. In virtue of relying upon the PSC method, this approach entails modest modeling requirements restricted to computation of the gravitational torque vector, and motor-side dynamics terms (typically available in manufacturer datasheets). Hence, it distinguishes itself by obviating the need for calculation of computationally cumbersome link-side dynamics elements, such as the Coriolis and link inertia matrices. In contrast to analogous schemes, the highest order term required by the proposed design is the third derivative of the motor position vector; it therefore avoids the usage of link-jerk feedback that can be detrimental to interactional performance. Moreover, the propounded framework enables utilisation of noncollocated feedback for enhanced tracking accuracy, as well as variable impedance control for interactional performance augmentation. The aforesaid features are effectuated without any reliance on coordinate transformations; thus, the original dynamical model's structure remains immutable throughout. Also, the proposed design's complexity is dependent solely on the gravitational torque vector's dimension (i.e., not on the link inertia or Coriolis terms). Experimental results involving a flexible-joint robot, namely the Rethink Robotics Baxter, corroborate the theoretical analyses, in addition to demonstrating that interactional performance improvements can be achieved via the proposed methodology.

- (2023) Vision-Based Approximate Estimation of Muscle Activation Patterns for Tele-Impedance, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2023.3293275.<br>
**Keywords**: Robots; Muscles; Sensors; Task analysis; Impedance; Electromyography; Visualization; Deep learning for visual perception; telerobotics and teleoperation; compliance and impedance control.<br>
**Abstract**: It lies in human nature to properly adjust the muscle force to perform a given task successfully. While transferring this control ability to robots has been a big concern among researchers, there is no attempt to make a robot learn how to control the impedance solely based on visual observations. Rather, the research on tele-impedance usually relies on special devices such as EMG sensors, which have less accessibility as well as less generalization ability compared to simple RGB webcams. In this letter, we propose a system for a vision-based tele-impedance control of robots, based on the approximately estimated muscle activation patterns. These patterns are obtained from the proposed deep learning-based model, which uses RGB images from an affordable commercial webcam as inputs. It is remarkable that our model does not require humans to apply any visible markers to their muscles. Experimental results show that our model enables a robot to mimic how humans adjust their muscle force to perform a given task successfully. Although our experiments are focused on tele-impedance control, our system can also provide a baseline for improvement of vision-based learning from demonstration, which would also incorporate the information of variable stiffness control for successful task execution.

- (2023) Robot-Assisted Haptic Rendering for Nail Hammering: A Representative of IADL Tasks, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3291751.<br>
**Keywords**: Task analysis; Robots; Haptic interfaces; Rendering (computer graphics); Force; Nails; Computational modeling; Haptic modeling and rendering; instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs); nail hammering; robot.<br>
**Abstract**: Restoring the capability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) is an imperative step towards independent living for neurologically impaired individuals. Robot-assisted task-oriented training with haptic feedback has the potential to enhance patients’ ability to perform IADLs. However, robot-assisted haptic rendering of IADLs is extremely challenging due to their complex dynamic properties and has been rarely reported. Considering the broad impedance range characteristics from free motion to hard contact, nail hammering (NH) is chosen as a representative IADL task. This paper presents our attempts to render the NH task via a customized robot. The core technologies consist of two aspects: 1) a robot-assisted haptic modeling technique with guaranteed accuracy and computation cost (by combining practical measurement data and experience-dependent analytical functions); 2) a robot-assisted haptic rendering technique involving a haptic robot with broad impedance range and sufficient force feedback (via a low gear ratio cable transmission and redundant actuation parallel mechanism) and closed-loop impedance control with guaranteed passivity and stability. Human experiments demonstrate an accurate NH task rendering that all Pearson correlation coefficients between real and virtual tasks are larger than 0.89. The modeling sensitivity analysis showed that stiffness parameter has the greatest effect on the realism of haptic rendering, with an effect size of 0.94. This study represents an important step towards comprehensive robot-assisted task-oriented therapy with haptic feedback. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this work is to explore the techniques of robot-assisted haptic rendering of IADL tasks. On the one hand, current task modeling approaches are hard to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. On the other hand, existing haptic platforms have difficulty in meeting the broad impedance range and large force output requirements. In this work, we firstly developed a customized haptic robot via redundant actuation (enabling high robotic stiffness and force output) and low gear ratio cable transmission (enabling low friction and high back-drivability). We then built the nail hammering (NH) task model by combining practical measurement data (for accuracy) and experience-dependent analytical functions (for computational efficiency). Finally, we achieved the haptic rendering of the NH task using closed-loop impedance control with passivity and stability analysis. The proposed robot-assisted haptic modeling and rendering techniques can be extended to the haptic display of other types of IADL tasks.

**Keywords**: Robots; Force; Impedance; Dynamics; Task analysis; Sea measurements; Robot kinematics; Assist-as-needed (AAN); human–robot interaction; impedance adaption; series elastic actuator (SEA)-driven robot.<br>
**Abstract**: Series elastic actuators (SEAs) have been the most popular compliant actuators as they possess a variety of advantages, such as high compliance, good backdrivability, and tolerance to shocks. They have been adopted by various rehabilitation robots to provide appropriate assistance with suitable compliance during human–robot interaction. For a multijoint SEA-driven rehabilitation robot, a big challenge is to develop an assist-as-needed (AAN) method without losing stability during uncertain physical human–robot interaction. For this purpose, this article proposes a human–robot interaction evaluation-based AAN method for upper limb rehabilitation robots driven by SEAs. First, in order to stabilize the SEA-level dynamics, singular perturbation theory is adopted to design a fast time-scale controller. Second, for the robot-level dynamics, an iterative learning algorithm is adopted for impedance adaption according to the task performance and human intention. The interaction force feedback is introduced for human–robot interaction evaluation, and the intensity of robotic assistance will be adjusted periodically according to the evaluation results. The stability of human–robot interaction is provided with the Lyapunov method. Finally, the proposed rehabilitation method is constructed and implemented on a two-degree-of-freedom SEA-driven robot. It handles the uncertain interaction in such a principle that correct movements will lead to less assistance for encouraging participation and incorrect movements will lead to more assistance for effective training. The proposed method adapts to the subject's intention and encourages higher participation by decreasing impedance learning strength and increasing allowable motion error. It can fit the participants with different motor capabilities and provide adaptive assistance when a specific trainee tries to change his/her participation during rehabilitation. The performance of the AAN method was validated with experimental studies involving healthy subjects.

**Keywords**: Impedance; Exoskeletons; Torque; Actuators; Fuzzy logic; Electromyography; Trajectory; Compliant actuator; electromyography (EMG); fuzzy logic; iterative learning control (ILC); rehabilitation robots.<br>
**Abstract**: The cascade impedance control (CIC) is a well-known architecture framework for rehabilitation exoskeleton with compliant joint (e.g., a series elastic actuator). The cascaded position–torque–velocity control loop of the CIC system can deal with specific issues, such as stiction or the accuracy of output impedance. In this article, the control loops of the CIC are extended by the traditional iterative learning control (ILC), and then we examine and compare three types of frameworks, namely, torque learning, impedance learning, and trajectory learning. Their advantages, such as reducing the lag of the output trajectory with a low-gain impedance controller (safety), are discovered. Furthermore, the exoskeleton system is upgraded with the ability of variable impedance. In this part, a fuzzy logic system is proposed. This system uses the electromyography (EMG) signals of the subject and the exoskeleton torque as input, and the decisions on the variable impedance as output. The experiment verifies that the proposed algorithm can effectively decrease the impedance of the exoskeleton when detecting a spasticity from the subject and can maintain the original dynamics of the system when the subject performs a normal movement. Afterward, the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic system together with the ILC-based CIC is experimentally verified in the case of subject–exoskeleton collaborative.

- (2023) Smoothly Connected Preemptive Impact Reduction and Contact Impedance Control, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2023.3286045.<br>
**Keywords**: Impedance; Force; Robots; Sensors; Robot sensing systems; Optical sensors; Optical switches; Contact transition; impact reduction; optical proximity sensor; sensor-based reactive control.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes novel control methods that lower impact force by preemptive movement and smooth transition to conventional contact-based impedance control. These techniques are suggested for application in force-control-based robots and position/velocity-control-based robots. Strong impact forces have a negative influence on multiple robotic tasks. Recently, preemptive impact reduction techniques that expand conventional contact impedance control using proximity sensors have been examined. However, a seamless transition from impact reduction to contact impedance control has yet to be demonstrated. It has, therefore, been necessary to switch control strategies or perform complicated parameter tuning. In contrast, our proposed methods utilize a serial combined impedance control framework to solve these problems. The preemptive impact reduction feature can be added to an already-implemented impedance controller because the parameter design is divided into impact reduction and contact impedance control. There is no discontinuity or abrupt alteration in the contact force, nor are there any excessively large contact forces that exceed the intended repulsive force established by the contact impedance control during the transition. Furthermore, although the preemptive impact reduction uses a crude optical proximity sensor, the influence of reflectance is minimized by employing a virtual viscous force. Analyses and real-world experiments with a 1-D mass model confirm these features, which are useful for many robots performing contact tasks.

- (2023) Closed-Loop Kinematic and Indirect Force Control of a Cable-Driven Knee Exoskeleton: A Lyapunov-Based Switched Systems Approach, **in** *IEEE Open Journal of Control Systems*, **DOI**: 10.1109/OJCSYS.2023.3289771.<br>
**Keywords**: Exoskeletons; Control systems; Trajectory; Knee; Kinematics; Electric motors; Actuators; Human-in-the-loop; lower-limb exoskeletons; lyapunov methods; nonlinear control; switched systems.<br>
**Abstract**: Lower-limb exoskeletons can aid restoring mobility in people with movement disorders. Cable-driven exoskeletons can offload their actuators away from the human body to reduce the weight imposed on the user and enable precise control of joints. However, ensuring limb coordination through bidirectional motion control of joints using cables raise the technical challenge of preventing the occurrence of undesired cable slackness or counteracting forces between cables. Thus, motivation exists to develop a control design framework that integrates both a joint control loop to ensure suitable limb tracking and a cable control loop to maintain cable tension properly. In this paper, a two-layer control structure consisting of high and low-level controllers are developed to ensure a knee-joint exoskeleton system follows the desired joint trajectories and adjusts the cable tension, respectively. A repetitive learning controller is designed for the high-level knee joint tracking objective motivated by the periodic nature of the desired leg swings (i.e., to achieve knee flexion and extension). Low-level robust controllers are developed for a pair of cables, each actuated by an electric motor, to track target motor trajectories composed of motor kinematics and offset angles to mitigate cable slackness. The offset angles are computed using admittance models that exploit measurements of the cable tensions as inputs. Each electric motor switches its role between tracking the knee joint trajectory (i.e., the motor acts as the leader motor to achieve flexion or extension) and implementing the low-level controller (i.e., the motor acts as the follower motor to reduce slackness). Hence, at any time, one motor is the leader and the other is the follower. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is developed for the high-level joint controller to ensure global asymptotic tracking and the low-level follower controller to guarantee global exponential tracking. The designed controllers are implemented during leg swing experiments in six able-bodied individuals while wearing the knee joint cable-driven exoskeleton. A comparison of the results obtained in two trials with and without using the admittance model (i.e., exploiting cable tension measurements) is presented. The experimental results indicate improved knee joint tracking performance, smaller control input magnitudes, and reduced cable slackness in the trial that leveraged cable tension feedback compared to the trial that did not exploit tension feedback.

- (2023) Feature-Engineering Enabled Multi-Objective Evolutionary Impedance Fitting Technique, **in** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TIE.2023.3288191.<br>
**Keywords**: Impedance; Fitting; Optimization; Equivalent circuits; Task analysis; Shape; Market research; Impedance fitting; feature engineering; multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.<br>
**Abstract**: The impedance fitting technique aims to make the impedance of an equivalent circuit the same as the measured impedance of the real system through parameter tuning. Since only the magnitude and phase of the impedance are measurable, the single-objective optimization algorithm, where the objective is to minimize the weighted summation of the fitting errors on magnitude and phase, has been widely used to achieve automatic impedance fitting. However, this scheme is easy to be trapped in the local minima, which, leads to poor fitting precision. A feature-engineering enabled multi-objective evolutionary impedance fitting (FEMEIF) technique is proposed in this paper. By implementing several effective feature engineering techniques to fully leverage the limited impedance information, and by utilizing these synergetic features to enable multi-objective impedance fitting for realizing better hierarchy on individuals, FEMEIF much improves the impedance fitting performance with higher fitting precision and lower optimization variance compared with the traditional single-objective impedance fitting schemes. FEMEIF provides a novel methodology for improving the impedance fitting task, requires no additional measurements or expenses, and is universal for various optimization algorithms or equivalent circuits. Besides, it provides an open topic for exploring other potential features to achieve further improvement. The effectiveness of the FEMEIF is verified separately on fitting the impedance of a generic RLC-parallel circuit and on an industrial application of fitting the common-mode impedance of a motor system.

**Keywords**: Robots; Robot sensing systems; Automotive components; Service robots; Collaboration; Safety; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Human–robot collaboration has demonstrated its potential to increase efficiency and productivity in industry. However, inherently safe collaborative robots offer limited payloads and are unsuitable for many heavy lifting and manipulation tasks that would benefit from collaboration. The use of high-payload robots in physical human–robot interaction poses significant safety and performance issues due to the robots’ high inertia and power. As a result, these robots either operate autonomously, spatially separated from humans, or at very low speeds, making collaboration ineffective. In this work, we develop an integrated system that allows humans to interact with a high-payload industrial robot in a safe and effective manner. By combining sensorized skin and perception systems to distinguish voluntary from involuntary contacts with a novel variable admittance control method, we achieve safe, stable, and efficient physical human–robot interaction. Our approach is experimentally validated by manipulating a more than 100-kg payload in a real-world scenario of car windshield inspection and preassembly from the automotive industry. In the validation experiments, we achieve faster, more flexible, more efficient, and more human-friendly execution of this task. Our work also contributes on a broader scale by paving the way for the adoption of human–robot comanipulation with high-payload robots.

**Keywords**: Robots; Impedance; Task analysis; Force; Stability analysis; Trajectory; Ethics; Human–robot–environment interaction control; impedance control; learning control.<br>
**Abstract**: Previous works have developed impedance control to increase safety and improve performance in contact tasks, where the robot is in physical interaction with either an environment or a human user. This article investigates impedance learning for a robot guided by a human user while interacting with an unknown environment. We develop automatic adaptation of robot impedance parameters to reduce the effort required to guide the robot through the environment, while guaranteeing interaction stability. For nonrepetitive tasks, this novel adaptive controller can attenuate disturbances by learning appropriate robot impedance. Implemented as an iterative learning controller, it can compensate for position dependent disturbances in repeated movements. Experiments demonstrate that the robot controller can, in both repetitive and nonrepetitive tasks: first, identify and compensate for the interaction, second, ensure both contact stability (with reduced tracking error) and maneuverability (with less driving effort of the human user) in contact with real environments, and third, is superior to previous velocity-based impedance adaptation control methods.

**Keywords**: Tracking; Robot sensing systems; Uncertainty; Upper bound; Observers; Electromyography; Trajectory; Teleoperation; Admittance control; Observer; Sliding mode control; Predefined-time stability.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a predefined-time sensorless admittance tracking control scheme for teleoperation systems in the presence of model uncertainty. To achieve personalized compliant performance, an admittance structure with adjustable stiffness parameter is employed, in which the torque behavior is observed by a predefined-time observer (PTO) and the adjustable stiffness parameter is obtained based on the operator's electromyographic (emg) signals. By virtue of the adjustable stiffness parameter, a trade-off can be made between compliant performance in interaction situation and tracking performance in free motion according to operator's requirement. By devising a PTO, lumped uncertainty arising from interaction and model uncertainty can be exactly observed within a predefined time, in conjunction with the nonsingular predefined-time terminal sliding manifold and predefined-time performance function (PTPF), and thereby contributing the entire PTO-based predefined-time control (PTO-PTC) scheme which can track the generated admittance trajectory fast and accurately without violating the error constraint. The observation and trajectory tracking errors can converge to the origin and its neighborhood within a predefined time, respectively, and the upper bound of the setting time can be determined with an explicit parameter in advance. Simulation and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PTO-PTC scheme.

**Abstract**: Non-volitional control, such as finite-state machine (FSM) impedance control,  does not directly incorporate user intent signals, while volitional control, like  direct myoelectric control (DMC), relies on these signals. This paper compares  the performance, capabilities, and perception of FSM impedance control to DMC on  a robotic prosthesis for subjects with and without transtibial amputation. It  then explores, using the same metrics, the feasibility and performance of the  combination of FSM impedance control and DMC across the full gait cycle, termed  Hybrid Volitional Control (HVC). After calibration and acclimation with each  controller, subjects walked for two minutes, explored the control capabilities,  and completed a questionnaire. FSM impedance control produced larger average peak  torque (1.15Nm/kg) and power (2.05 W/kg) than DMC (0.88 Nm/kg and 0.94 W/kg). The  discrete FSM, however, caused non-standard kinetic and kinematic trajectories,  while DMC yielded trajectories qualitatively more similar to able-bodied  biomechanics. While walking with HVC, all subjects successfully achieved ankle  push-off and were able to modulate the magnitude of push-off via the the  volitional input. Unexpectedly, however, HVC behaved either more similarly to FSM  impedance control or to DMC alone, rather than in combination. Both DMC and HVC,  but not FSM impedance control, allowed subjects to achieve unique activities such  as tip-toe standing, foot tapping, side-stepping, and backward walking.  Able-bodied subject (N=6) preferences were split amongst the controllers, while  all transtibial subjects (N=3) preferred DMC. Desired performance and ease of use  showed the highest correlations with overall satisfaction (0.81 and 0.82,  respectively).

**Keywords**: Admittance control; Robots; Robustness; Force; Q measurement; Linear systems; Human-robot interaction; Human-robot interaction; Robust admittance control; Multi-objective complementary control.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper studies a robust admittance control problem with a passivity requirement for stable and unstable linear time-invariant systems, motivated by control issues originated from physical human-robot interaction. A complementary admittance control structure is proposed and analyzed, revealing that the nominal performance (admittance tracking and passivity) is decoupled from robustness. Simulations on the admittance control for human arm strength augmentation with a passivity requirement validate the proposed controller design.

**Keywords**: Task analysis; Collaboration; Robots; Robot kinematics; Data models; Trajectory; Real-time systems; Wearable robotics; human-robot collaboration; human performance augmentation; supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs).<br>
**Abstract**: Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) are novel wearable robots that can be used to augment human operating ability in completing some difficult and complex tasks. In this work, a task-based human-SRLs collaboration control method for overhead tasks is developed. It is autonomous and safe without the need for active commands and previous data. A task model is proposed to model the human-SRLs collaboration process that features different task states and state transition conditions. Specifically, the overhead task process is modeled as a finite state machine (FSM) with four task states, three trigger events, and three SRLs actions. The real-time measured human motion data is utilized to trigger the task state transition and estimate the task parameters, which are the constraints for SRLs motion planning. The proposed admittance control with adjustable parameters allows SRLs to behave like spring-damping systems with different characteristics in different states and actions. The admittance control enhances the safety and reliability of the human-SRLs interaction. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method for overhead tasks is further validated on a prototype of the human-SRLs system with two subjects under different installation heights. Trigger events and task parameters are successfully detected and estimated during the task process to trigger the coordination actions of SRLs. The results demonstrate that the task-based collaboration method is useful for overhead tasks with different task parameters.

- (2023) Task Space Compliant Control and Six-Dimensional Force Regulation Toward Automated Robotic Ultrasound Imaging, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3282974.<br>
**Keywords**: Robots; Force; Imaging; Robot sensing systems; Probes; Aerospace electronics; Task analysis; Robotic ultrasound; admittance control; force control; coupled stability.<br>
**Abstract**: Objective: We propose a general control framework for task space compliant motion and six-dimensional (6-D) force regulation towards automated robotic ultrasound (US) imaging. The framework endows a position-controlled robotic manipulator with the capability of accurate compliant motion in free space and accurate force control in motion-constrained environment. Methods: An intuitive six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) admittance control model expressed in an arbitrary Cartesian body frame is mathematically derived with closed-form task space error mapping. Its practical implementation on widely-used collaborative manipulators is proposed to achieve full task space compliant behaviors and accurate 6-D force control. A hybrid control law is presented to achieve good motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. The coupled model of physical human-robot interaction is established and the reason for the improved coupled stability is analyzed through simulation. Results: Evaluation experiments on the proposed control framework were performed to show the effectiveness. The mean error of compliant trajectory following was less than 0.30 mm in free space. The mean relative force and moment control accuracy in three orthogonal directions was better than 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The improved coupled stability under the same model parameters was also confirmed by human-robot interaction experiments. Finally, an automated robotic US imaging experiment on a human volunteer in a real clinical scenario was carried out to show the potential application of our proposed framework. Conclusion: Experimental results have shown the advantages of the control framework, including satisfied force control accuracy, high accuracy of compliant motion, improved coupled stability, and system effectiveness on a human volunteer. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the increasing needs of automated ultrasound (US) scanning for both diagnostic and interventional purpose. Clinical sonographers suffer from repeated workload when performing diagnostic US imaging, which could benefit from automated robotic scanning. Robotic US imaging involves physical interaction between the robot end-effector (i.e., US transducer) and the human body. The dynamics of the interaction is regulated by the control law to guarantee the contact of the US transducer and the safety of the procedure. Most existing works have focused on regulating in-plane contact force in terms of the position without considering the compliance in other dimensions. However, it is not a trivial work to extend the positional compliance to six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) compliance. As the prevalence of low-cost collaborative robotic arms in medical scenarios, how to perform 6-DoF compliant trajectory following and accurate six-dimensional (6-D) force control on these robotic arms becomes increasingly important. This paper gives a complete general solution to achieve 6-DoF compliant control and 6-D force regulation with accurate kinematics on a position-controlled robotic arm. A hybrid control law is proposed to switch the government of “instantaneous model” and “theoretical model” to achieve compliant motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. No expensive torque sensors and torque control interface are required. And no prior geometric knowledge about the scanning object is needed. We have demonstrated the application for robotic US imaging in a real clinical scenario.

**Keywords**: Sensors; Robots; Haptic interfaces; Robot sensing systems; Actuators; End effectors; Deformation; Haptic interfaces; Robots; robot control; robot kinematics; soft robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, we propose a new continuum robotics approach for haptic rendering and comanipulation. This approach is illustrated using a robotic interface with six motorized fixed axes connected by deformable beams, in parallel, to an end effector with 5 degrees of freedom. Apart from the rotation of the motors, this design has no articulation, and the motion of the end effector is achieved by deformation of the beams. The flexible beams are equipped with bending sensors, and the motors have encoders. We use a nonlinear finite element mechanical model of the robot based on a mesh of beam elements that is computed in real time at 20 Hz. The bending sensors are incorporated into the model, which allows us to obtain an accurate estimate of the force exerted by the user on the end effector. The model enables a new methodology for calculating the workspace of the continuum haptic device. The model also is propagated to a higher frequency loop (500 Hz), which performs sensing and control of the robot at high rates, using an admittance-type control to command new positions of the actuators. We show that this control methodology allows haptic rendering of virtual walls that are stiffer than the natural stiffness of the robot. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the device for simple comanipulation tasks.

**Keywords**: Robots; Trajectory; Force; Mathematical models; Dynamics; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Rehabilitation robotics; Learning from demonstrations; Reversible Dynamic Movement Primitives; Gaussian Mixture Regression; Parallel robot.<br>
**Abstract**: The development of robotic-assisted rehabilitation exercises involving physical human-robot interaction requires extreme care since an injured limb may be in physical contact with the robot, so compliant behavior is imperative for these tasks. Typical approaches involve force control schemes like admittance controllers that allow humans to adapt the motion. However, when the patient's limb has limited mobility or is potentially injured, unintentional forces may occur during the robot's trajectory that could be incompatible with these controllers. This paper addresses a new way of generating compliant trajectories for passive rehabilitation exercises, considering that previous positions of the trajectory are attainable for the patient, so reversing the trajectory is a safe operation. Since there is no clear way to optimize such a goal due to the physiological variability among patients, the condition of reversal is based on imitation learning by taking the analogous healthy limb of the patient as a reference and encoding the forces using Gaussian Mixture Regression, and reversibility is accomplished by means of Reversible Dynamic Movement Primitives. The system allows for self-paced rehabilitation exercises by back-and-forth movements along the trajectory according to the patient's reaction, and it has been successfully applied to a 4-DOF parallel robot for lower-limb rehabilitation.

- (2023) Formation Planning for Tethered Multirotor UAV Cooperative Transportation With Unknown Payload and Cable Length, **in** *IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3279827.<br>
**Keywords**: Payloads; Transportation; Planning; Underwater cables; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Collision avoidance; Vehicle dynamics; Aerial cooperative system; cooperative transportation; formation planning; admittance control.<br>
**Abstract**: This study investigates the formation planning problem of tethered multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative transportation with unknown payload and cable length. Normally, the transportation formation and trajectory are given in advance or designed based on the coupled system model. It is challenging to dynamically generate flexible formations in response to changing environments when the payload and cable length are unknown. This paper proposes an online formation planning method for multirotor UAVs. First, by analyzing the tension on cables, we propose some formation criteria and further construct a corresponding performance function of optimization. Then, desired trajectories/formations that can reduce the cost functions are generated by using the admittance model. Next, an estimation-based formation tracking control is designed, which ensures that multirotor UAVs follow the desired trajectories/formations. Finally, numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the formation planning problem of tethered multirotor UAV cooperative transportation. In industry and production applications, a team of multirotor UAVs has a larger load capacity than a single one. Nevertheless, the formation planning of the tethered cooperative transportation is challenging, especially when the payload and cable length are unknown. Rather than give a predefined formation or trajectory, this paper suggests an online formation planning method for multirotor UAVs in case of unknown payload and cable length. The method is implemented through the following three parts: 1) By analyzing the tension on cables, we propose some formation criteria and further construct a corresponding performance function of optimization. 2) By using the admittance model, we generate desired trajectories/formations that can minimize the proposed cost function. 3) By estimating cable tension, we design formation tracking control laws for multirotor UAVs to follow the desired trajectories/formations. The proposed formation planning method does not rely on the knowledge of the payload and length of cables, which makes it can be easily applied to extensive industry, production, and military practice. Finally, numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

- (2023) Adaptive Fingers Coordination for Robust Grasp and In-Hand Manipulation Under Disturbances and Unknown Dynamics, **in** *IEEE Trans. Robot.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TRO.2023.3280028.<br>
**Keywords**: Coupled dynamical systems; dexterous manipulation; finger gating; grasping; object with uneven mass distribution; robust/adaptive control of robotic systems.<br>
**Abstract**: We present a control framework for achieving a robust object grasp and manipulation in hand. In-hand manipulation remains a demanding task as the object is never stable and task success relies on carefully synchronizing the fingers' dynamics. Indeed, fingers must simultaneously generate motion while maintaining contact with the object and, by staying within the hand's frame, ensuring that the object remains manipulable. These challenges are exacerbated once the hand gets disturbed or when the internal dynamics of the manipulated object are unknown, such as when it is filled with liquid moving during manipulation. We present a control strategy based on coupled dynamical systems (DSs), whereby the fingers move in synchronization using an intermediate dynamics responsible for coordinating fingers. To adapt to changes in forces due to model uncertainties and unexpected disturbances, we employ an adaptive torque-controller combined with a joint impedance regulator that guarantees high tracking accuracy while adapting to dynamic changes. We validate the approach in multiple experiments on 16-degrees-of-freedom robotic hand grasping and manipulating objects with different mass properties, e.g., uneven or varying mass distribution in a glass half-filled with water. We show that the robot can compensate for disturbances generated by internal dynamics and external perturbations. Additionally, we showcase how our controller, in conjunction with learning from human demonstration, provides a robust solution for more complicated manipulations such as finger gaiting.

**Keywords**: Integrated circuits; Control systems; Impedance; Force; Artificial neural networks; Adaptive systems; Uncertainty; Adaptive control; event-triggered control (ETC); impedance control (IC); neural network (NN); robotic system.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents an event-triggered adaptive neural impedance control (ETANIC) scheme for robotic systems, where the combination of impedance control (IC) and event-triggered mechanism can significantly reduce the computational burden and the communication cost under the premise of ensuring the stability and tracking performances of the robotic systems. The IC is used to achieve the compliant behavior of the robotic systems in response to the environment. The uncertainties of the robotic systems are estimated by the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and the update laws for RBFNN are derived from the designed Lyapunov function. The stability of the whole closed-loop control system is analyzed by the Lyapunov theory, and the event-triggered conditions are designed to avoid the Zeno behavior. The numerical simulation and experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed ETANIC scheme can achieve better efficiency for controlling the robotic systems to perform the interaction tasks with the environment in comparison to the adaptive neural IC (ANIC).

**Keywords**: Muscles; Torque; Sensors; Voltage measurement; Impedance; Torque measurement; Conductivity; Electrical impedance; human joint torque; muscle force; machine learning.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper offers an impedance sensing method taking advantage of the conductivity changes due to muscle contraction to estimate muscle-driven joint torques through a convolutional neural network (CNN) where the input images are derived from a finite set of boundary voltage measurements. Guided by a physical model combining the forearm biomechanics and the muscle electric field along with the CNN criteria considering the receptive fields, the effects of two image formats (for quasi-static and dynamic states) on the CNN performance are experimentally studied on eight human subjects’ forearms using a prototype impedance sensing system. By comparing the CNN-estimated torques with that measured on a haptic device, the findings verify that the impedance-based method can estimate the joint torques driven by both the deep and superficial muscles within 9% errors of the three degrees-of-freedom wrist torque and 10% error of the gripping torque, and that it is feasible to share data among a similar group to reduce data collection and time when training a CNN for uses on a new subject.

**Keywords**: Manipulators; Robots; Force; Impedance; Springs; Surface impedance; Couplings; Grinding robot; model-based prediction control; optimal impedance control.<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, a grinding robot for large area and an impedance-based force control method applied to the robot are described. With the development of science and technology, the demand for various industrial robots increased, and among them, the demand and importance of grinding robots that require high risk and precision increased. In particular, research on grinding robots targeting large areas has not been conducted relatively, and accordingly, the design and control mechanism of robots specialized in large areas was needed. A robot consisting of a manipulator and a grinding module with a 2-DOF parallel structure is proposed as the design of a new grinding robot. The control method is based on impedance force control mainly used in existing grinding robots, but to overcome the limitations of using only impedance control, the impedance control via model-based prediction optimization (MPO) is proposed as a control technique for grinding robots. Experiments were conducted to verify the force tracking ability of the proposed control, resulting in a 28.1% improvement in settling time for the desired force. Even for disturbance, more improved recovery performance than conventional controllers has been verified. As a result, proposed impedance force control via MPO shows improved force tracking performance over conventional impedance control, and is presented as one of the appropriate control methods for grinding robots targeting large areas.

- (2023) Compliant Control of Flexible Joint by Dual-Disturbance Observer and Predictive Feedforward, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2023.3272364.<br>
**Keywords**: Torque; Trajectory; 3-DOF; Admittance; Transfer functions; Impedance; Estimation; Admittance control; disturbance observer (DOB); flexible joint; force estimation; impedance control; sensitivity; trajectory prediction.<br>
**Abstract**: The compliant control of a flexible joint relies on the accurate external torque information and effective internal disturbance compensation. To achieve this, most of the prior works use a built-in torque sensor and a lumped disturbance observer based on a single encoder. This increases the weight and cost of the system. In this article, a novel dual-disturbance observer (DDOB) based on the encoder feedbacks from both the motor and link sides is proposed so that the friction and external torque are estimated and compensated separately without the torque sensor. Thereby, a feedforward–feedback–DDOB composite scheme is formed for position control. The modified reference sensitivity of this scheme suggests that better tracking accuracy and disturbance rejection ability are achieved. In addition, the estimated external torque is used to alternate the reference trajectory with the given admittance model. To ensure that the feedforward control is realizable, the prediction of the alternated trajectory is done by the online fitting of a polynomial. The output turbulence caused by prediction errors is effectively suppressed by a single deadbeat compensator with the most ancient prediction in memory, while other predictions are weighted by the time-varying ratios. Simulations and real-time experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical appeal of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Robots; Task analysis; Collaboration; Robot kinematics; Service robots; Impedance; Admittance.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents a robust and reliable human–robot collaboration (HRC) framework for bimanual manipulation. We propose an optimal motion adaptation method to retarget arbitrary human commands to feasible robot pose references while maintaining payload stability. The framework comprises three modules: 1) a task-space sequential equilibrium and inverse kinematics optimization (task-space SEIKO) for retargeting human commands and enforcing feasibility constraints, 2) an admittance controller to facilitate compliant human–robot physical interactions, and 3) a low-level controller improving stability during physical interactions. Experimental results show that the proposed framework successfully adapted infeasible and dangerous human commands into continuous motions within safe boundaries and achieved stable grasping and maneuvering of large and heavy objects on a real dual-arm robot via teleoperation and physical interaction. Furthermore, the framework demonstrated the capability in the assembly task of building blocks and the insertion task of industrial power connectors.

**Keywords**: Robots; Impedance; Task analysis; Predictive models; Human-robot interaction; Aerospace electronics; Torque; Physical human-robot interaction; impedance control; passivity; model predictive control.<br>
**Abstract**: Various cognitive systems have been designed to model the position and stiffness profiles of human behavior and then to drive robots by mimicking the human’s behavior to accomplish physical human-robot interaction tasks through a properly designed impedance controller. However, some studies have shown that variable stiffness parameters of the impedance controller can cause the violation of the passivity constraint of the robot states, and make the robot’s stored energy exceed the external energy injected from the human user, thus leading to the unsafe human-robot interaction. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel passive model predictive impedance control method including two control loops. In the bottom-loop of the proposed controller, the robot is driven by a variable impedance controller to achieve the desired compliant interaction behavior. In the top-loop of the proposed controller, the model predictive control (MPC) is used to ensure that the robot states satisfy the passivity constraint by calculating a complementary torque to limit the stored energy of the robot. The passivity of the closed-loop robot system and the feasibility of MPC are guaranteed by theoretical analysis, ensuring the safety of the robotic movement in the human-robot interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulation and experiment on the Franka Emika Panda robot.

**Keywords**: Robots; Perturbation methods; Impedance; Force; Legged locomotion; Impedance measurement; Biomechanics; Assistive robotics; Medical robots and systems; Rehabilitation robotics.<br>
**Abstract**: Objective: This paper presents a twin dual-axis robotic platform system which is designed for the characterization of postural balance under various environmental conditions and quantification of bilateral ankle mechanics in 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) during standing and walking. Methods: Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate performance of the system 1) to apply accurate position perturbations under different loading conditions, 2) to simulate a range of stiffness-defined mechanical environments, and 3) to reliably quantify the joint impedance of mechanical systems. In addition, several human experiments were performed to demonstrate the system’s applicability for various lower limb biomechanics studies. The first two experiments quantified postural balance on a compliance-controlled surface (passive perturbations) and under oscillatory perturbations with various frequencies and amplitudes (active perturbations). The second two experiments quantified bilateral ankle mechanics, specifically, ankle impedance in 2-DOF during standing and walking. Results: The validation experiments showed high accuracy of the platform system to apply position perturbations, simulate a range of mechanical environments, and quantify the joint impedance. Results of the human experiments further demonstrated that the platform system is sensitive enough to detect differences in postural balance control under challenging environmental conditions as well as bilateral differences in 2-DOF ankle mechanics. Conclusion: This robotic platform system will allow us to better understand lower limb biomechanics during functional tasks, while also providing invaluable knowledge for the design and control of many robotic systems including robotic exoskeletons, prostheses and robot-assisted balance training programs.

- (2023) Hybrid Force-Impedance Control for Fast End-Effector Motions, **in** *IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett.*, **DOI**: 10.1109/LRA.2023.3270036.<br>
**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Controlling the contact force on various surfaces is essential in many robotic applications such as in service tasks or industrial use cases. Mostly, classical impedance and hybrid motion-force control approaches are employed for these kinds of physical interaction scenarios. In this work, an extended Cartesian impedance control algorithm is developed, which includes geometrical constraints and enables explicit force tracking in a hybrid manner. The unified framework features compliant behavior in the free (motion) task directions and explicit force tracking in the constrained directions. Advantageously, the involved force subspace in contact direction is fully dynamically decoupled from dynamics in the motion subspace. The experimental validation with a torque-controlled robotic manipulator on both flat and curved surfaces demonstrates the performance during highly dynamic desired trajectories and confirms the theoretical claims of the approach.

**Keywords**: Robots; Force; Indexes; Robot kinematics; Task analysis; Predictive models; Tracking; Cooperative control; cooperative index; dual-arm robot; nonlinear model predictive control (MPC).<br>
**Abstract**: Dual-arm robots show better task adaptability but face more constraints than single-arm robots. Inspired by human cooperation options, a nonlinear model predictive cooperative control (NMPCC) coupled with a cooperative index is proposed in this article. By adjusting the cooperative index, dual-arm cooperation can be classified into four modes: tracking, motion synchronization, impedance, and force priority. Thus, the cooperation operation problem is converted to a multiobjective optimization problem. Then, a nonlinear model predictive solver coupled with the ACADO toolkit is designed to solve the multiobjective optimization problem, where the robotic torque control input can be calculated in real time (less than 1 ms). The motion synchronization, cooperative transportation, and human dual-arm robot interaction experiments were conducted on dual Franka panda robots. Experiments reveal that the NMPCC control coupled with the cooperative index is easy to apply in dual-arm robots and can adapt to different complex manipulation tasks.

**Keywords**: Torque; Dielectrics; Safety; Force; Friction; Stators; Rotors; Adjustable clutch; electroadhesion (EA); rotary clutch; smart actuators.<br>
**Abstract**: The increasing need for sharing workspace and interactive physical tasks between robots and humans has raised concerns regarding the safety of such operations. In this regard, controllable clutches have shown great potential for addressing important safety concerns at the hardware level by separating the high-impedance actuator from the end-effector by providing the power transfer from electromagnetic source to the human. However, the existing clutches suffer from high power consumption and large weight, which make them undesirable from the design point of view. In this article, for the first time, the design and development of a novel, lightweight, and low-power torque-adjustable rotary clutch using electroadhesive materials are presented. The performance of three different pairs of clutch plates is investigated in the context of the smoothness and quality of output torque. The performance degradation issue due to the polarization of the insulator is addressed through the utilization of an alternating current waveform activation signal. Moreover, the effect of the activation frequency on the output torque and power consumption of the clutch is investigated. Finally, a time-dependent model for the output torque of the clutch is presented, and the performance of the clutch was evaluated through experiments, including physical human–robot interaction. The proposed clutch offers a torque-to-power consumption ratio that is six times better than commercial magnetic particle clutches. The proposed clutch presents great potential for developing safe, lightweight, and low-power physical human–robot interaction systems, such as exoskeletons and robotic walkers.

**Keywords**:**Abstract**: Green energies and electric mobility are considered exciting solutions to help reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This scenario has significantly promoted the use of electric drives; consequently, higher technical requirements are assumed as mandatory. Focusing on the required high-performance electric drives, the direct control of power converters and the use of integrated modulators, namely, control techniques that avoid the pulse-width modulation stage, can be an attractive alternative to conventional linear controllers. For example, Model Predictive Control (MPC) presents inherent flexibility in defining control objectives, while Direct Torque Control (DTC) provides a fast dynamic response. Unfortunately, unacceptable harmonic distortion can appear in the system if single control action is applied per control cycle. This scenario promotes a higher current ripple in three-phase electric drives when a control scheme using a standard integrated modulator is implemented. The situation is even worse when multiphase drives are used since several orthogonal subspaces need to be regulated with a single control action. In addition, the characteristic low value of the equivalent impedance of the secondary subspaces may lead to enormous harmonic currents. Considering the previous scenario, although the dynamic response is very fast in direct controllers (control scheme based on integrated modulators), these control strategies could be discarded due to their high harmonic distortion. Fortunately, the disadvantages of direct control strategies can be mitigated by using enhanced integrated modulators, such as multi-vector solutions as control actions. On the other hand, as these control techniques’ performance is founded on the nature of the available voltage vectors, the use of some specific electric drives, such as symmetrical six-phase machines, can allow taking advantage of their desirable skills.

- (2023) A DMP-Based Motion Generation Scheme for Robotic Mirror Therapy, **in** *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, **DOI**: 10.1109/TMECH.2023.3255218.<br>
**Keywords**: Robots; Muscles; Trajectory; Mirrors; Medical treatment; Impedance; Electromyography; Dynamic movement primitive (DMP); rehabilitation robot; reinforcement learning; robotic mirror therapy.<br>
**Abstract**: Hemiparesis has become prevalent in recent years, and robot-assisted rehabilitation provides great therapeutic potential. Robotic mirror therapy is a promising approach for hemiplegic patients by transmitting the motion of the healthy limb (HL) to the impaired limb (IL), where the wearable robot assists the IL to mimic the HL's action to stimulate the active participation of the injured muscles. However, complete replication of the HL's movement trajectory without considering the IL's muscle strength is not satisfactory for rehabilitation. In this article, a motion generation scheme is proposed for robotic mirror therapy. The robot's movement trajectory is modeled with dynamic movement primitive (DMP), and the physical human–robot interaction is formulated as an impedance model and coupled with the DMP model. The subject's muscle strength is evaluated with skin surface electromyography signals and transferred to the robot's joint stiffness. In order to adapt the human–robot coupled DMP model parameters to varying subject performance, a reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to optimize the robot's movement trajectory and stiffness profile, where the training safety and rehabilitation improvement are both guaranteed. The proposed method is validated using a lower extremity rehabilitation robot, and experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and superiority.

**Keywords**: Adaptive force control; curved surface; Force; Force control; Impedance; modified dynamic movement primitive (DMP); redundant robot; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory; trajectory planning; Trajectory planning.<br>
**Abstract**: Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) have been widely applied in robot motion planning and control. However, in some special cases, original discrete DMP fails to generalize proper trajectories. Moreover, it is difficult to produce trajectories on the curved surface. To solve the above problems, a modified DMP method is proposed for robot control by adding the scaling factor and force coupling term. First, the adjusted cosine similarity is defined to assess the similarity of the generalized trajectory with respect to the demonstrated trajectory. By optimizing the similarity, the trajectories can be generated in all situations. Next, by adding the force coupling term derived from adaptive admittance control to the transformation system of the original DMP, the controller achieves the force control ability. Then, the modified DMP-based robot control system is developed. The stability and convergence of the system are proved. Finally, the high precisions of the proposed method are verified by simulations and experiments. The method is significant for trajectory learning and generalization on the curved surface.

**Abstract**: We present in this article a new decentralized iterative learning cooperative impedance control (ILCIC) architecture to cooperatively control the impedance for a team of robot manipulators that operate over an iteration domain. With a new definition of the neighborhood impedance error, we propose a novel formation-based cooperative control architecture, so that every manipulator can achieve the desired impedance model, even when some manipulators do not have direct access to the desired angle profiles. Besides, the desired angle profiles as well as the desired impedance model can be iteration varying, which is an important consideration when the team needs to execute different tasks in different iterations. With rigorous mathematical analysis, we show that each manipulator’s impedance error can uniformly converge to zero as the iteration index increases to infinity. A simulation study is discussed in order to further illustrate the effectiveness of the discussed algorithm.

**Abstract**: Trajectory optimization (TO) combined with whole-body control (WBC) have been a widely accepted approach for dynamic gait control of quadruped robots. However, there are still open issues in this framework, one is the lack of a unified description of intrinsic inter-limb coordination for wide range of gaits and their transitions in TO, another is motion compliance against disturbances arisen from transitions while maintaining accurate tracking performance. In this letter, we introduce the reduced antero-posterior sequence (APS) gait parametrization approach into the model predictive control (MPC) based TO. The APS gait parametrization, which is enforced as equality constraints in optimization model, enables the representation of diverse gaits, symmetrical and asymmetrical, with five parameters and offers an intuitive way to efficiently implement gait transitions with linear interpolation of gait parameters. We also construct a whole-body impedance controller that integrates the operational impedance controller into WBC, allowing to compliantly track the optimized torso state trajectories and contact forces. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in simulations and experiments. The results indicate that the test robot is able to robustly locomote with various gaits, including diagonal walk, trot, bound, flying trot and traverse gallop at a variety of speeds, and smoothly implement gait transitions among these gaits. Compared to existing gait transition approach, ours can obtain better reference tracking performance and higher energy efficiency during gait transitions.

**Abstract**: This article proposes an adaptive fuzzy neural network (NN) command filtered impedance control for constrained robotic manipulators with disturbance observers. First, barrier Lyapunov functions are introduced to handle the full-state constraints. Second, the adaptive fuzzy NN is introduced to handle the unknown system dynamics and a disturbance observer is designed to eliminate the effect of unknown bound disturbance. Then, a modified auxiliary system is designed to suppress the input saturation effect. In addition, the command filtered technique and error compensation mechanism are used to directly obtain the derivative of the virtual control law and improve the control accuracy. The barrier Lyapunov theory is used to prove that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation studies are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

**Keywords**: Aerial manipulator; Cameras; image-based visual servoing (IBVS); Impedance; impedance control; line features; Manipulators; nonlinear observer; Observers; Task analysis; virtual camera.; Visual servoing; Visualization.<br>
**Abstract**: Contact-based aerial interaction control in unknown environments is a challenging issue. To solve this problem, this paper presents an image-based impedance control scheme for an aerial manipulator. Unlike points and image moments, the line features considered in this paper cannot uniquely determine the pose of the onboard camera. Therefore, a nonlinear observer is proposed to online provide supplementary 3D information of the system. After that, a hierarchical tracking controller, which is equipped with an image-space impedance filter, is designed to implement a trajectory tracking task with tunable compliance, while at the same time achieving a subtask that aims to determine the final pose of the aerial manipulator. By planning task-space trajectories, desired interaction behavior can be specified without relying on the global position of the system. Furthermore, the effectiveness criterion of the observer is derived, and the stability of the system is proven. Several experiments, including a push-and-slide task, robustness analysis, and a comparison with the state of the art have been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the method.

**Keywords**: Impedance; Neural network; potential field; Robot kinematics; robotic system; Robots; Service robots; Task analysis; Trajectory; virtual impedance control; visual sensing; Visualization.<br>
**Abstract**: This article proposes a vision-based virtual impedance control (VBVIC) scheme for the robotic system without prespecified task trajectory, where a neural network (NN) is used to compensate for the unmodeled dynamics and parameter uncertainties. In the proposed scheme, a novel control framework combined virtual potential field (VPF) with the impedance control is proposed to achieve noncontact impedance control, where the task trajectory does not need to be prespecified but is generated by integrating the bioinspired Tau-J into the virtual impedance model. Moreover, the virtual force generated by VPF is utilized to achieve the shaping and tracking of the task trajectory in the virtual impedance control scheme, and the information of target and obstacle is obtained by the visual sensing. The proposed VPF-based VBVIC scheme is analyzed by the Lyapunov stability theory and validated by a carrying task in simulations and experiments, respectively.

**Keywords**: Aerial manipulation; Aerodynamics; Aerospace electronics; Cameras; hierarchical control; image-based visual servoing (IBVS); Impedance; impedance control; Manipulators; Task analysis; Visual servoing.<br>
**Abstract**: This article presents an image-based impedance control scheme for an under-actuated aerial manipulator. Unlike the existing Cartesian cascade control (admittance control) scheme, we design an image-space visual servoing controller at the dynamic level to achieve compliant interaction with unknown environments. Furthermore, compared with the state of the art in aerial interaction control, feedback of both the external wrench and the Cartesian position of the aerial manipulator are not required. To cope with the under-actuation property of the system, an attitude tracking control task is designed in such a way that it is dynamically decoupled with the visual impedance control task. Convergence of the task-space tracking error is proven based on the Lyapunov theory. The finite-gain ${\mathcal{L}}_2$ stability of the system regarding external force/disturbance is also proven. Indoor experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Robots; Parallel robots; Robot sensing systems; Legged locomotion; Collaboration; Impedance; Task analysis; Backdrivability; impedance control; macro–mini system; parallel robot; physical human–robot interaction (pHRI).<br>
**Abstract**: In this article, we investigate the characteristics of a collaborative hybrid parallel robot. A comparison between this robot and other collaborative robots regarding the Cartesian inertia is presented to highlight the very low inertia of the hybrid parallel robot. A task space stiffness-damping control is also proposed. In order to improve the performance of macro--mini systems in the interaction context, an active macro-active mini system consisting of the hybrid parallel robot mounted on a three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) gantry translational robot is introduced. A control strategy for physical human–robot interaction is applied to the macro--mini arrangement. The stability of this method is analyzed and it is shown that the macro–mini combination is more stable than the mini alone. An experimental validation is then carried out. The results obtained with the hybrid parallel robot show that the desired interaction force can be tracked at high speed and that prescribed impedance parameters can be precisely rendered to the human operator without using any additional sensor. Also, it is pointed out that the bandwidth of interaction of the hybrid parallel robot, as well as of the macro--mini system is much higher than that of other commercial collaborative robots. In addition, other tests are realized on the macro–mini system in order to verify the performance and to demonstrate potential applications. The macro–mini robot introduced in this work yields a very intuitive human–robot interaction, which makes it ideal for many applications in which direct physical teaching or assistance is needed.

**Keywords**: aerial vehicles; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Cameras; Force; Impedance; impedance control; Physical human-robot interaction; Robots; Vehicle dynamics; visual servoing; Visualization.<br>
**Abstract**: Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) in the field of aerial vehicles has received more research attention in recent years. In this work, a visual impedance control strategy for human-aerial robot cooperative transportation with a tethered vehicle is presented. Without a positioning system, the aerial vehicle is controlled to follow the human partner by using cable force and visual features of the object as feedback. Furthermore, being aware of human motion is important to improve efficiency and smoothness of the cooperation. Without measuring velocities of the aerial vehicle and the human, we propose to directly estimate relative velocity of them by a vision-based velocity observer. This estimated velocity is then integrated into a visual impedance scheme. The stability of the system is rigorously proved by Lyapunov analysis and passivity analysis. Indoor experiments where a human participant transports a long bar with a tethered aerial vehicle are conducted. Results of experiments under different human velocities and intentions demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.

**Keywords**: Dynamics; Force; Impedance; Impedance control; impedance learning; iterative learning; physical human–robot interaction (PHRI); repetitive learning control; robot control; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; Robots; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: Model-based impedance learning control can provide variable impedance regulation for robots through online impedance learning without interaction force sensing. However, the existing related results only guarantee the closed-loop control systems to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and require the human impedance profiles being periodic, iteration-dependent, or slowly varying. In this article, a repetitive impedance learning control approach is proposed for physical human–robot interaction (PHRI) in repetitive tasks. The proposed control is composed of a proportional-differential (PD) control term, an adaptive control term, and a repetitive impedance learning term. Differential adaptation with projection modification is designed for estimating robotic parameters uncertainties in the time domain, while fully saturated repetitive learning is proposed for estimating time-varying human impedance uncertainties in the iterative domain. Uniform convergence of tracking errors is guaranteed by the PD control and the use of projection and full saturation in the uncertainties estimation and is theoretically proved based on a Lyapunov-like analysis. In impedance profiles, the stiffness and damping are composed of an iteration-independent term and an iteration-dependent disturbance, which are estimated by repetitive learning and compressed by the PD control, respectively. Therefore, the developed approach can be applied to the PHRI where iteration-dependent disturbances exist in the stiffness and damping. The control effectiveness and advantages are validated by simulations on a parallel robot in a repetitive following task.

**Keywords**: Conductivity; electrical impedance tomography; Electrical impedance tomography; proprioceptive sensing; Robot sensing systems; Sensors; Shape; Soft robotics; soft sensors and actuators; Strain.<br>
**Abstract**: With infinite degrees of freedom, soft robots are expected to achieve dexterous and complex tasks, but this also puts forward higher requirements for their sensing capabilities. An important sensing task in soft robots is sensing their own deformation and current shape. Currently, most of the existing soft shaping sensors are limited by local perception abilities, stretchability, and fabrication difficulties. We propose a sensing method based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which reconstructs conductivity patterns distributed on a surface, by considering the deformation-caused resistance changes. Comparison between the theoretical and experimental patterns reveals that even though the quality of the pattern is affected by a large amount of noise, the considered features are still able to reflect the change of shape. With the help of neural networks, the pattern is decoded to the physical data related to the deformation. Detection of the planar shape changes and proprioception of a sensor-integrated soft robot are presented to exhibit the capability of our method. Results show that the detected error ratios are mostly under 5% and 3% for 2D and 3D conditions respectively.

**Keywords**: Control; End effectors; impedance; Impedance; Jacobian matrices; planning; Planning; Robots; Sensors; Task analysis.<br>
**Abstract**: The attention given to impedance control in recent years does not match a similar focus on the choice of impedance values that the controller should execute. Current methods are hardly general and often compute fixed controller gains relying on the use of expensive sensors. In this article, we address the problem of online impedance planning for Cartesian impedance controllers that do not assign the closed-loop inertia. We propose an optimization-based algorithm that, given the Cartesian inertia, computes the stiffness and damping gains without relying on force/torque measurements and so that the effects of perturbations are less than a maximum acceptable value. By doing so, we increase robot resilience to unexpected external disturbances while guaranteeing performance and robustness. The algorithm provides an analytical solution in the case of impedance-controlled robots with diagonally dominant inertia matrix. Instead, established numerical methods are employed to deal with the more common case of nondiagonally dominant inertia. Our work attempts to create a general impedance planning framework, which needs no additional hardware and is easily applicable to any robotic system. Through experiments on real robots, including a quadruped and a robotic arm, our method is shown to be employable in real time and to lead to satisfactory behaviors.

**Keywords**: Aerial manipulation; Cameras; Force; force tracking; Impedance; impedance control; Target tracking; Task analysis; Visual servoing; Visualization.<br>
**Abstract**: In this paper, an image-based impedance control strategy for force tracking of an unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM) is presented. Firstly, image features with nice decoupling characteristics are designed and the relationship between the camera motion and the image features is derived. Then, a two-stage strategy is proposed to achieve force tracking of the UAM on a planar object in an arbitrary pose. The first stage drives the end-effector perpendicular to the object's planer surface by pure visual servoing. To achieve force tracking under the visual guidance, an adaptive visual impedance control method which adjusts the target stiffness according to the force tracking error and the visual feature error is proposed in the second stage. The closed-loop system is proved asymptotically stable by means of Lyapunov analysis. Further, the stability in free flight phase of the stage two is also analyzed and ensured. Finally, experiments were carried out including a whiteboard cleaning task in different poses. The experimental results illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Keywords**: Biological system modeling; Impedance; Impedance control; Kinematics; Legged locomotion; Mathematical models; optimization; prostheses; Task analysis; Torque.<br>
**Abstract**: Most impedance-based walking controllers for powered knee–ankle prostheses use a finite state machine with dozens of user-specific parameters that require manual tuning by technical experts. These parameters are only appropriate near the task (e.g., walking speed and incline) at which they were tuned, necessitating many different parameter sets for variable-task walking. In contrast, this article presents a data-driven, phase-based controller for variable-task walking that uses continuously variable impedance control during stance and kinematic control during swing to enable biomimetic locomotion. After generating a data-driven model of variable joint impedance with convex optimization, we implement a novel task-invariant phase variable and real-time estimates of speed and incline to enable autonomous task adaptation. Experiments with above-knee amputee participants ($N=2$) show that our data-driven controller 1) features highly linear phase estimates and accurate task estimates, 2) produces biomimetic kinematic and kinetic trends as task varies, leading to low errors relative to able-bodied references, and 3) produces biomimetic joint work and cadence trends as task varies. We show that the presented controller meets and often exceeds the performance of a benchmark finite state machine controller for our two participants, without requiring manual impedance tuning.

**Keywords**: Adaptation models; Dynamics; Estimation; Hidden Markov models; Human motion intention; Impedance; Robots; stochastic analysis; variable impedance control; wearable robots; Wearable robots.<br>
**Abstract**: Understanding human motion intention is fundamental to wearable robots, which are designed to provide assistance by assessing the intention of wearers. Although modeling human motion intention during physical interaction reveals the fundamental properties of wearable robots, uncertainty and random noise are commonly neglected in existing works. This article presents an adaptive intention-driven variable impedance controller, where the online estimation of human motion intention is realized subject to physical interaction, stochastic distribution, and random disturbance. Specifically, human motion intention is estimated under a dual-channel structure and is represented as both the immediate desired position of the human limb and its predicted future position. A new variable impedance model is formulated from the estimated intention to regulate the dynamic interaction between the human and the robot. Such an impedance model is defined as the control objective achieved using the adaptive controller for wearable compliantly driven robots. The proposed formulation will be able to improve the estimation accuracy of human motion intention and will allow the robot to match the human’s action in a safe and efficient manner. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven from the stochastic perspective, and the experimental results on the compliantly driven exoskeleton robot are presented to validate the performance of the proposed controller.

**Keywords**: Prosthetics; Synchronous motors; Torque; Impedance; Knee; Belts; Wheels; Backdrivability; impedance control; knee prosthesis; synchronous belt; working noise.<br>
**Abstract**: Working noise is an important consideration that hinders the acceptance of powered prostheses by amputees. In this article, we present a powered knee prosthesis with low noise and high backdrivability. The powertrain of the proposed prosthesis consists of a motor and a four-stage synchronous belt to decrease working noise. At the same time, benefiting from the low impedance of the motor and low impedance design, the proposed prosthesis is endowed with the characteristics of low impedance, and thus, high backdrivability. A three-layer control method based on a finite state machine is implemented, and walking experiments have been carried out on a transfemoral amputee. The results show the characteristics of the proposed prosthesis in low impedance, low noise, and the ability to reproduce a natural gait. In particular, the working noise of the proposed prosthesis is less than 46 dBA most time, which is lower than common household appliances, and may have positive effects on the acceptance of daily uses.

**Keywords**: Heuristic algorithms; Hidden Markov models; Impedance; Kernel; Kernelized movement primitives; learning from demonstrations; MV-GP; Robots; Task analysis; Trajectory; variable impedance control.<br>
**Abstract**: This paper proposes a novel learning from demonstrations (LfD) method based on kernelized movement primitives (KMP). The original KMP algorithm is excellent at generalizing and handling high-dimensional inputs, but it is slightly inadequate in reproduction accuracy. To address this issue, we make two improvements to the KMP algorithm. Firstly, a multivariate Gaussian process (MV-GP) is employed to model the reference trajectory, which preliminarily improves the reproduction accuracy of KMP. Secondly, an optimization problem is formulated to learn the hyperparameters of the kernel function in KMP, which reduces the dependence on experience. We also propose a novel variable impedance control (VIC) approach to trade off contact compliance against tracking accuracy by utilizing the probabilistic properties of the KMP. Comparative simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed LfD algorithm.
